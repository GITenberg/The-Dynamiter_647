<p><i>Gentlemen,&mdash;In the volume now in your hands</i>,
<i>the authors have touched upon that ugly devil of crime</i>,
<i>with which it is your glory to have contended</i>.&nbsp; <i>It
were a waste of ink to do so in a serious spirit</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Let us dedicate our horror to acts of a more mingled
strain</i>, <i>where crime preserves some features of
nobility</i>, <i>and where reason and humanity can still relish
the temptation</i>.&nbsp; <i>Horror</i>, <i>in this case</i>,
<i>is due to Mr. Parnell</i>: <i>he sits before posterity
silent</i>, <i>Mr. Forster&rsquo;s appeal echoing down the
ages</i>.&nbsp; <i>Horror is due to ourselves</i>, <i>in that we
have so long coquetted with political crime</i>; <i>not seriously
weighing</i>, <i>not acutely following it from cause to
consequence</i>; <i>but with a generous</i>, <i>unfounded heat of
sentiment</i>, <i>like the schoolboy with the penny tale</i>,
<i>applauding what was specious</i>.&nbsp; <i>When it touched
ourselves</i> (<i>truly in a vile shape</i>), <i>we proved false
to the imaginations</i>; <i>discovered</i>, <i>in a clap</i>,
<i>that crime was no less cruel and no less ugly under sounding
names</i>; <i>and recoiled from our false deities</i>.</p>

<p>It is within the bounds of possibility that you may take up
this volume, and yet be unacquainted with its predecessor: the
first series of <span class="smcap">New Arabian
Nights</span>.&nbsp; The loss is yours&mdash;and mine; or to be
more exact, my publishers&rsquo;.&nbsp; But if you are thus
unlucky, the least I can do is to pass you a hint.&nbsp; When you
shall find a reference in the following pages to one Theophilus
Godall of the Bohemian Cigar Divan in Rupert Street, Soho, you
must be prepared to recognise, under his features, no less a
person than Prince Florizel of Bohemia, formerly one of the
magnates of Europe, now dethroned, exiled, impoverished, and
embarked in the tobacco trade.</p>

1</span><i>PROLOGUE OF THE CIGAR DIVAN</i></h2>
<p>In the city of encounters, the Bagdad of the West, and, to be
more precise, on the broad northern pavement of Leicester Square,
two young men of five- or six-and-twenty met after years of
separation.&nbsp; The first, who was of a very smooth address and
clothed in the best fashion, hesitated to recognise the pinched
and shabby air of his companion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;Paul Somerset!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am indeed Paul Somerset,&rsquo; returned the other,
&lsquo;or what remains of him after a well-deserved experience of
poverty and law.&nbsp; But in you, Challoner, I can perceive no
change; and time may be said, without hyperbole, to write no
wrinkle on your azure brow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All,&rsquo; replied Challoner, &lsquo;is not gold that
glitters.&nbsp; But we are here in an ill posture for
confidences, and interrupt the movement of these ladies.&nbsp;
Let us, if you please, find a more private corner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you will allow me to guide you,&rsquo; replied
Somerset, &lsquo;I will offer you the best cigar in
London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And taking the arm of his companion, he led him in silence and
at a brisk pace to the door of a quiet establishment in Rupert
Street, Soho.&nbsp; The entrance was adorned with one of those
gigantic Highlanders of wood which have almost risen to the
standing of antiquities; and across the window-glass, which
sheltered the usual display of pipes, tobacco, and cigars, there
ran the gilded legend: &lsquo;Bohemian Cigar Divan, by T.
Godall.&rsquo;&nbsp; The interior of the shop was small, but
commodious and ornate; the salesman grave, smiling, and urbane;
and the two young men, each puffing a select regalia, had soon
taken their places on a sofa of mouse-coloured plush and
proceeded to exchange their stories.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am now,&rsquo; said Somerset, &lsquo;a barrister; but
Providence and the attorneys have hitherto denied me the
opportunity to shine.&nbsp; A select society at the Cheshire
Cheese engaged my evenings; my afternoons, as Mr. Godall could
testify, have been generally passed in this divan; and my
mornings, I have taken the precaution to abbreviate by not rising
before twelve.&nbsp; At this rate, my little patrimony was very
rapidly, and I am proud to remember, most agreeably
expended.&nbsp; Since then a gentleman, who has really nothing
else to recommend him beyond the fact of being my maternal uncle,
deals me the small sum of ten shillings a week; and if you behold
me once more revisiting the glimpses of the street lamps in my
favourite quarter, you will readily divine that I have come into
a fortune.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should not have supposed so,&rsquo; replied
Challoner.&nbsp; &lsquo;But doubtless I met you on the way to
your tailors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a visit that I purpose to delay,&rsquo; returned
Somerset, with a smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;My fortune has definite
limits.&nbsp; It consists, or rather this morning it consisted,
of one hundred pounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is certainly odd,&rsquo; said Challoner;
&lsquo;yes, certainly the coincidence is strange.&nbsp; I am
myself reduced to the same margin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You!&rsquo; cried Somerset.&nbsp; &lsquo;And yet
Solomon in all his glory&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such is the fact.&nbsp; I am, dear boy, on my last
legs,&rsquo; said Challoner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Besides the clothes in
which you see me, I have scarcely a decent trouser in my
wardrobe; and if I knew how, I would this instant set about some
sort of work or commerce.&nbsp; With a hundred pounds for
capital, a man should push his way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may be,&rsquo; returned Somerset; &lsquo;but what to
do with mine is more than I can fancy.&nbsp; Mr. Godall,&rsquo;
he added, addressing the salesman, &lsquo;you are a man who knows
the world: what can a young fellow of reasonable education do
with a hundred pounds?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It depends,&rsquo; replied the salesman, withdrawing
his cheroot.&nbsp; &lsquo;The power of money is an article of
faith in which I profess myself a sceptic.&nbsp; A hundred pounds
will with difficulty support you for a year; with somewhat more
difficulty you may spend it in a night; and without any
difficulty at all you may lose it in five minutes on the Stock
Exchange.&nbsp; If you are of that stamp of man that rises, a
penny would be as useful; if you belong to those that fall, a
penny would be no more useless.&nbsp; When I was myself thrown
unexpectedly upon the world, it was my fortune to possess an art:
I knew a good cigar.&nbsp; Do you know nothing, Mr.
Somerset?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not even law,&rsquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The answer is worthy of a sage,&rsquo; returned Mr.
Godall.&nbsp; &lsquo;And you, sir,&rsquo; he continued, turning
to Challoner, &lsquo;as the friend of Mr. Somerset, may I be
allowed to address you the same question?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied Challoner, &lsquo;I play a fair
hand at whist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How many persons are there in London,&rsquo; returned
the salesman, &lsquo;who have two-and-thirty teeth?&nbsp; Believe
me, young gentleman, there are more still who play a fair hand at
whist.&nbsp; Whist, sir, is wide as the world; &rsquo;tis an
accomplishment like breathing.&nbsp; I once knew a youth who
announced that he was studying to be Chancellor of England; the
design was certainly ambitious; but I find it less excessive than
that of the man who aspires to make a livelihood by
whist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said Challoner, &lsquo;I am afraid I
shall have to fall to be a working man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fall to be a working man?&rsquo; echoed Mr.
Godall.&nbsp; &lsquo;Suppose a rural dean to be unfrocked, does
he fall to be a major? suppose a captain were cashiered, would he
fall to be a puisne judge?&nbsp; The ignorance of your middle
class surprises me.&nbsp; Outside itself, it thinks the world to
lie quite ignorant and equal, sunk in a common degradation; but
to the eye of the observer, all ranks are seen to stand in
ordered hierarchies, and each adorned with its particular
aptitudes and knowledge.&nbsp; By the defects of your education
you are more disqualified to be a working man than to be the
ruler of an empire.&nbsp; The gulf, sir, is below; and the true
learned arts&mdash;those which alone are safe from the
competition of insurgent laymen&mdash;are those which give his
title to the artisan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a very pompous fellow,&rsquo; said Challoner,
in the ear of his companion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is immense,&rsquo; said Somerset.</p>
<p>Just then the door of the divan was opened, and a third young
fellow made his appearance, and rather bashfully requested some
tobacco.&nbsp; He was younger than the others; and, in a somewhat
meaningless and altogether English way, he was a handsome
lad.&nbsp; When he had been served, and had lighted his pipe and
taken his place upon the sofa, he recalled himself to Challoner
by the name of Desborough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Desborough, to be sure,&rsquo; cried Challoner.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, Desborough, and what do you do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fact is,&rsquo; said Desborough, &lsquo;that I am
doing nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A private fortune possibly?&rsquo; inquired the
other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, no,&rsquo; replied Desborough, rather
sulkily.&nbsp; &lsquo;The fact is that I am waiting for something
to turn up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All in the same boat!&rsquo; cried Somerset.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And have you, too, one hundred pounds?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Worse luck,&rsquo; said Mr. Desborough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a very pathetic sight, Mr. Godall,&rsquo; said
Somerset: &lsquo;Three futiles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A character of this crowded age,&rsquo; returned the
salesman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Somerset, &lsquo;I deny that the age
is crowded; I will admit one fact, and one fact only: that I am
futile, that he is futile, and that we are all three as futile as
the devil.&nbsp; What am I?&nbsp; I have smattered law, smattered
letters, smattered geography, smattered mathematics; I have even
a working knowledge of judicial astrology; and here I stand, all
London roaring by at the street&rsquo;s end, as impotent as any
baby.&nbsp; I have a prodigious contempt for my maternal uncle;
but without him, it is idle to deny it, I should simply resolve
into my elements like an unstable mixture.&nbsp; I begin to
perceive that it is necessary to know some one thing to the
bottom&mdash;were it only literature.&nbsp; And yet, sir, the man
of the world is a great feature of this age; he is possessed of
an extraordinary mass and variety of knowledge; he is everywhere
at home; he has seen life in all its phases; and it is impossible
but that this great habit of existence should bear fruit.&nbsp; I
count myself a man of the world, accomplished,
<i>cap-&agrave;-pie</i>.&nbsp; So do you, Challoner.&nbsp; And
you, Mr. Desborough?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; returned the young man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well then, Mr. Godall, here we stand, three men of the
world, without a trade to cover us, but planted at the strategic
centre of the universe (for so you will allow me to call Rupert
Street), in the midst of the chief mass of people, and within
ear-shot of the most continuous chink of money on the surface of
the globe.&nbsp; Sir, as civilised men, what do we do?&nbsp; I
will show you.&nbsp; You take in a paper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I take,&rsquo; said Mr. Godall solemnly, &lsquo;the
best paper in the world, the <i>Standard</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good,&rsquo; resumed Somerset.&nbsp; &lsquo;I now hold
it in my hand, the voice of the world, a telephone repeating all
men&rsquo;s wants.&nbsp; I open it, and where my eye first
falls&mdash;well, no, not Morrison&rsquo;s Pills&mdash;but here,
sure enough, and but a little above, I find the joint that I was
seeking; here is the weak spot in the armour of society.&nbsp;
Here is a want, a plaint, an offer of substantial gratitude:
&ldquo;<i>Two hundred Pounds Reward</i>.&mdash;The above reward
will be paid to any person giving information as to the identity
and whereabouts of a man observed yesterday in the neighbourhood
of the Green Park.&nbsp; He was over six feet in height, with
shoulders disproportionately broad, close shaved, with black
moustaches, and wearing a sealskin great-coat.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There, gentlemen, our fortune, if not made, is
founded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you then propose, dear boy, that we should turn
detectives?&rsquo; inquired Challoner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do I propose it?&nbsp; No, sir,&rsquo; cried
Somerset.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is reason, destiny, the plain face of
the world, that commands and imposes it.&nbsp; Here all our
merits tell; our manners, habit of the world, powers of
conversation, vast stores of unconnected knowledge, all that we
are and have builds up the character of the complete
detective.&nbsp; It is, in short, the only profession for a
gentleman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The proposition is perhaps excessive,&rsquo; replied
Challoner; &lsquo;for hitherto I own I have regarded it as of all
dirty, sneaking, and ungentlemanly trades, the least and
lowest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To defend society?&rsquo; asked Somerset; &lsquo;to
stake one&rsquo;s life for others? to deracinate occult and
powerful evil?&nbsp; I appeal to Mr. Godall.&nbsp; He, at least,
as a philosophic looker-on at life, will spit upon such
philistine opinions.&nbsp; He knows that the policeman, as he is
called upon continually to face greater odds, and that both worse
equipped and for a better cause, is in form and essence a more
noble hero than the soldier.&nbsp; Do you, by any chance, deceive
yourself into supposing that a general would either ask or
expect, from the best army ever marshalled, and on the most
momentous battle-field, the conduct of a common constable at
Peckham Rye?&rsquo; <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not understand we were to join the force,&rsquo;
said Challoner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor shall we.&nbsp; These are the hands; but
here&mdash;here, sir, is the head,&rsquo; cried Somerset.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Enough; it is decreed.&nbsp; We shall hunt down this
miscreant in the sealskin coat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suppose that we agreed,&rsquo; retorted Challoner,
&lsquo;you have no plan, no knowledge; you know not where to seek
for a beginning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Challoner!&rsquo; cried Somerset, &lsquo;is it possible
that you hold the doctrine of Free Will?&nbsp; And are you devoid
of any tincture of philosophy, that you should harp on such
exploded fallacies?&nbsp; Chance, the blind Madonna of the Pagan,
rules this terrestrial bustle; and in Chance I place my sole
reliance.&nbsp; Chance has brought us three together; when we
next separate and go forth our several ways, Chance will
continually drag before our careless eyes a thousand eloquent
clues, not to this mystery only, but to the countless mysteries
by which we live surrounded.&nbsp; Then comes the part of the man
of the world, of the detective born and bred.&nbsp; This clue,
which the whole town beholds without comprehension, swift as a
cat, he leaps upon it, makes it his, follows it with craft and
passion, and from one trifling circumstance divines a
world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; said Challoner; &lsquo;and I am
delighted that you should recognise these virtues in
yourself.&nbsp; But in the meanwhile, dear boy, I own myself
incapable of joining.&nbsp; I was neither born nor bred as a
detective, but as a placable and very thirsty gentleman; and, for
my part, I begin to weary for a drink.&nbsp; As for clues and
adventures, the only adventure that is ever likely to occur to me
will be an adventure with a bailiff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now there is the fallacy,&rsquo; cried Somerset.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There I catch the secret of your futility in life.&nbsp;
The world teems and bubbles with adventure; it besieges you along
the street: hands waving out of windows, swindlers coming up and
swearing they knew you when you were abroad, affable and doubtful
people of all sorts and conditions begging and truckling for your
notice.&nbsp; But not you: you turn away, you walk your seedy
mill round, you must go the dullest way.&nbsp; Now here, I beg of
you, the next adventure that offers itself, embrace it in with
both your arms; whatever it looks, grimy or romantic, grasp
it.&nbsp; I will do the like; the devil is in it, but at least we
shall have fun; and each in turn we shall narrate the story of
our fortunes to my philosophic friend of the divan, the great
Godall, now hearing me with inward joy.&nbsp; Come, is it a
bargain?&nbsp; Will you, indeed, both promise to welcome every
chance that offers, to plunge boldly into every opening, and,
keeping the eye wary and the head composed, to study and piece
together all that happens?&nbsp; Come, promise: let me open to
you the doors of the great profession of intrigue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not much in my way,&rsquo; said Challoner,
&lsquo;but, since you make a point of it, amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind promising,&rsquo; said Desborough,
&lsquo;but nothing will happen to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O faithless ones!&rsquo; cried Somerset.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But at least I have your promises; and Godall, I perceive,
is transported with delight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I promise myself at least much pleasure from your
various narratives,&rsquo; said the salesman, with the customary
calm polish of his manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now, gentlemen,&rsquo; concluded Somerset,
&lsquo;let us separate.&nbsp; I hasten to put myself in
fortune&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; Hark how, in this quiet corner, London
roars like the noise of battle; four million destinies are here
concentred; and in the strong panoply of one hundred pounds,
payable to the bearer, I am about to plunge into that
web.&rsquo;</p>

13</span>CHALLONER&rsquo;S ADVENTURE</h2>
<h3><i>THE SQUIRE OF DAMES</i></h3>
<p>Mr. Edward Challoner had set up lodgings in the suburb of
Putney, where he enjoyed a parlour and bedroom and the sincere
esteem of the people of the house.&nbsp; To this remote home he
found himself, at a very early hour in the morning of the next
day, condemned to set forth on foot.&nbsp; He was a young man of
a portly habit; no lover of the exercises of the body; bland,
sedentary, patient of delay, a prop of omnibuses.&nbsp; In
happier days he would have chartered a cab; but these luxuries
were now denied him; and with what courage he could muster he
addressed himself to walk.</p>
<p>It was then the height of the season and the summer; the
weather was serene and cloudless; and as he paced under the
blinded houses and along the vacant streets, the chill of the
dawn had fled, and some of the warmth and all the brightness of
the July day already shone upon the city.&nbsp; He walked at
first in a profound abstraction, bitterly reviewing and repenting
his performances at whist; but as he advanced into the labyrinth
of the south-west, his ear was gradually mastered by the
silence.&nbsp; Street after street looked down upon his solitary
figure, house after house echoed upon his passage with a ghostly
jar, shop after shop displayed its shuttered front and its
commercial legend; and meanwhile he steered his course, under
day&rsquo;s effulgent dome and through this encampment of diurnal
sleepers, lonely as a ship.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; he reflected, &lsquo;if I were like my
scatter-brained companion, here were indeed the scene where I
might look for an adventure.&nbsp; Here, in broad day, the
streets are secret as in the blackest night of January, and in
the midst of some four million sleepers, solitary as the woods of
Yucatan.&nbsp; If I but raise my voice I could summon up the
number of an army, and yet the grave is not more silent than this
city of sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was still following these quaint and serious musings when
he came into a street of more mingled ingredients than was common
in the quarter.&nbsp; Here, on the one hand, framed in walls and
the green tops of trees, were several of those discreet,
<i>bijou</i> residences on which propriety is apt to look
askance.&nbsp; Here, too, were many of the brick-fronted barracks
of the poor; a plaster cow, perhaps, serving as ensign to a
dairy, or a ticket announcing the business of the mangler.&nbsp;
Before one such house, that stood a little separate among walled
gardens, a cat was playing with a straw, and Challoner paused a
moment, looking on this sleek and solitary creature, who seemed
an emblem of the neighbouring peace.&nbsp; With the cessation of
the sound of his own steps the silence fell dead; the house stood
smokeless: the blinds down, the whole machinery of life arrested;
and it seemed to Challoner that he should hear the breathing of
the sleepers.</p>
<p>As he so stood, he was startled by a dull and jarring
detonation from within.&nbsp; This was followed by a monstrous
hissing and simmering as from a kettle of the bigness of St.
Paul&rsquo;s; and at the same time from every chink of door and
window spirted an ill-smelling vapour.&nbsp; The cat disappeared
with a cry.&nbsp; Within the lodging-house feet pounded on the
stairs; the door flew back, emitting clouds of smoke; and two men
and an elegantly dressed young lady tumbled forth into the street
and fled without a word.&nbsp; The hissing had already ceased,
the smoke was melting in the air, the whole event had come and
gone as in a dream, and still Challoner was rooted to the
spot.&nbsp; At last his reason and his fear awoke together, and
with the most unwonted energy he fell to running.</p>
<p>Little by little this first dash relaxed, and presently he had
resumed his sober gait and begun to piece together, out of the
confused report of his senses, some theory of the
occurrence.&nbsp; But the occasion of the sounds and stench that
had so suddenly assailed him, and the strange conjunction of
fugitives whom he had seen to issue from the house, were
mysteries beyond his plummet.&nbsp; With an obscure awe he
considered them in his mind, continuing, meanwhile, to thread the
web of streets, and once more alone in morning sunshine.</p>
<p>In his first retreat he had entirely wandered; and now,
steering vaguely west, it was his luck to light upon an
unpretending street, which presently widened so as to admit a
strip of gardens in the midst.&nbsp; Here was quite a stir of
birds; even at that hour, the shadow of the leaves was grateful;
instead of the burnt atmosphere of cities, there was something
brisk and rural in the air; and Challoner paced forward, his eyes
upon the pavement and his mind running upon distant scenes, till
he was recalled, upon a sudden, by a wall that blocked his
further progress.&nbsp; This street, whose name I have forgotten,
is no thoroughfare.</p>
<p>He was not the first who had wandered there that morning; for
as he raised his eyes with an agreeable deliberation, they
alighted on the figure of a girl, in whom he was struck to
recognise the third of the incongruous fugitives.&nbsp; She had
run there, seemingly, blindfold; the wall had checked her career:
and being entirely wearied, she had sunk upon the ground beside
the garden railings, soiling her dress among the summer
dust.&nbsp; Each saw the other in the same instant of time; and
she, with one wild look, sprang to her feet and began to hurry
from the scene.</p>
<p>Challoner was doubly startled to meet once more the heroine of
his adventure, and to observe the fear with which she shunned
him.&nbsp; Pity and alarm, in nearly equal forces, contested the
possession of his mind; and yet, in spite of both, he saw himself
condemned to follow in the lady&rsquo;s wake.&nbsp; He did so
gingerly, as fearing to increase her terrors; but, tread as
lightly as he might, his footfalls eloquently echoed in the empty
street.&nbsp; Their sound appeared to strike in her some strong
emotion; for scarce had he begun to follow ere she paused.&nbsp;
A second time she addressed herself to flight; and a second time
she paused.&nbsp; Then she turned about, and with doubtful steps
and the most attractive appearance of timidity, drew near to the
young man.&nbsp; He on his side continued to advance with similar
signals of distress and bashfulness.&nbsp; At length, when they
were but some steps apart, he saw her eyes brim over, and she
reached out both her hands in eloquent appeal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you an English gentleman?&rsquo; she cried.</p>
<p>The unhappy Challoner regarded her with consternation.&nbsp;
He was the spirit of fine courtesy, and would have blushed to
fail in his devoirs to any lady; but, in the other scale, he was
a man averse from amorous adventures.&nbsp; He looked east and
west; but the houses that looked down upon this interview
remained inexorably shut; and he saw himself, though in the full
glare of the day&rsquo;s eye, cut off from any human
intervention.&nbsp; His looks returned at last upon the
suppliant.&nbsp; He remarked with irritation that she was
charming both in face and figure, elegantly dressed and gloved; a
lady undeniable; the picture of distress and innocence; weeping
and lost in the city of diurnal sleep.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I protest you have no
cause to fear intrusion; and if I have appeared to follow you,
the fault is in this street, which has deceived us
both.&rsquo;&nbsp; An unmistakable relief appeared upon the
lady&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; &lsquo;I might have guessed it!&rsquo;
she exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thank you a thousand times!&nbsp; But
at this hour, in this appalling silence, and among all these
staring windows, I am lost in terrors&mdash;oh, lost in
them!&rsquo; she cried, her face blanching at the words.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I beg you to lend me your arm,&rsquo; she added with the
loveliest, suppliant inflection.&nbsp; &lsquo;I dare not go
alone; my nerve is gone&mdash;I had a shock, oh, what a
shock!&nbsp; I beg of you to be my escort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear madam,&rsquo; responded Challoner heavily,
&lsquo;my arm is at your service.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She took it and clung to it for a moment, struggling
with her sobs; and the next, with feverish hurry, began to lead
him in the direction of the city.&nbsp; One thing was plain,
among so much that was obscure: it was plain her fears were
genuine.&nbsp; Still, as she went, she spied around as if for
dangers; and now she would shiver like a person in a chill, and
now clutch his arm in hers.&nbsp; To Challoner her terror was at
once repugnant and infectious; it gained and mastered, while it
still offended him; and he wailed in spirit and longed for
release.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; he said at last, &lsquo;I am, of course,
charmed to be of use to any lady; but I confess I was bound in a
direction opposite to that you follow, and a word of
explanation&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; she sobbed, &lsquo;not here&mdash;not
here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The blood of Challoner ran cold.&nbsp; He might have thought
the lady mad; but his memory was charged with more perilous
stuff; and in view of the detonation, the smoke and the flight of
the ill-assorted trio, his mind was lost among mysteries.&nbsp;
So they continued to thread the maze of streets in silence, with
the speed of a guilty flight, and both thrilling with
incommunicable terrors.&nbsp; In time, however, and above all by
their quick pace of walking, the pair began to rise to firmer
spirits; the lady ceased to peer about the corners; and
Challoner, emboldened by the resonant tread and distant figure of
a constable, returned to the charge with more of spirit and
directness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought,&rsquo; said he, in the tone of conversation,
&lsquo;that I had indistinctly perceived you leaving a villa in
the company of two gentlemen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you need not fear to wound
me by the truth.&nbsp; You saw me flee from a common
lodging-house, and my companions were not gentlemen.&nbsp; In
such a case, the best of compliments is to be frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought,&rsquo; resumed Challoner, encouraged as much
as he was surprised by the spirit of her reply, &lsquo;to have
perceived, besides, a certain odour.&nbsp; A noise, too&mdash;I
do not know to what I should compare it&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silence!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;You do not know
the danger you invoke.&nbsp; Wait, only wait; and as soon as we
have left those streets, and got beyond the reach of listeners,
all shall be explained.&nbsp; Meanwhile, avoid the topic.&nbsp;
What a sight is this sleeping city!&rsquo; she exclaimed; and
then, with a most thrilling voice, &lsquo;&ldquo;Dear God,&rdquo;
she quoted, &ldquo;the very houses seem asleep, and all that
mighty heart is lying still.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I perceive, madam,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you are a
reader.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am more than that,&rsquo; she answered, with a
sigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am a girl condemned to thoughts beyond her
age; and so untoward is my fate, that this walk upon the arm of a
stranger is like an interlude of peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They had come by this time to the neighbourhood of the
Victoria Station and here, at a street corner, the young lady
paused, withdrew her arm from Challoner&rsquo;s, and looked up
and down as though in pain or indecision.&nbsp; Then, with a
lovely change of countenance, and laying her gloved hand upon his
arm&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What you already think of me,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I
tremble to conceive; yet I must here condemn myself still
further.&nbsp; Here I must leave you, and here I beseech you to
wait for my return.&nbsp; Do not attempt to follow me or spy upon
my actions.&nbsp; Suspend yet awhile your judgment of a girl as
innocent as your own sister; and do not, above all, desert
me.&nbsp; Stranger as you are, I have none else to look to.&nbsp;
You see me in sorrow and great fear; you are a gentleman,
courteous and kind: and when I beg for a few minutes&rsquo;
patience, I make sure beforehand you will not deny me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Challoner grudgingly promised; and the young lady, with a
grateful eye-shot, vanished round the corner.&nbsp; But the force
of her appeal had been a little blunted; for the young man was
not only destitute of sisters, but of any female relative nearer
than a great-aunt in Wales.&nbsp; Now he was alone, besides, the
spell that he had hitherto obeyed began to weaken; he considered
his behaviour with a sneer; and plucking up the spirit of revolt,
he started in pursuit.&nbsp; The reader, if he has ever plied the
fascinating trade of the noctambulist, will not be unaware that,
in the neighbourhood of the great railway centres, certain early
taverns inaugurate the business of the day.&nbsp; It was into one
of these that Challoner, coming round the corner of the block,
beheld his charming companion disappear.&nbsp; To say he was
surprised were inexact, for he had long since left that sentiment
behind him.&nbsp; Acute disgust and disappointment seized upon
his soul; and with silent oaths, he damned this commonplace
enchantress.&nbsp; She had scarce been gone a second, ere the
swing-doors reopened, and she appeared again in company with a
young man of mean and slouching attire.&nbsp; For some five or
six exchanges they conversed together with an animated air; then
the fellow shouldered again into the tap; and the young lady,
with something swifter than a walk, retraced her steps towards
Challoner.&nbsp; He saw her coming, a miracle of grace; her
ankle, as she hurried, flashing from her dress; her movements
eloquent of speed and youth; and though he still entertained some
thoughts of flight, they grew miserably fainter as the distance
lessened.&nbsp; Against mere beauty he was proof: it was her
unmistakable gentility that now robbed him of the courage of his
cowardice.&nbsp; With a proved adventuress he had acted strictly
on his right; with one who, in spite of all, he could not quite
deny to be a lady, he found himself disarmed.&nbsp; At the very
corner from whence he had spied upon her interview, she came upon
him, still transfixed, and&mdash;&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; she cried,
with a bright flush of colour.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah!&nbsp;
Ungenerous!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sharpness of the attack somewhat restored the Squire of
Dames to the possession of himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; he returned, with a fair show of
stoutness, &lsquo;I do not think that hitherto you can complain
of any lack of generosity; I have suffered myself to be led over
a considerable portion of the metropolis; and if I now request
you to discharge me of my office of protector, you have friends
at hand who will be glad of the succession.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stood a moment dumb.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is well,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go! go, and
may God help me!&nbsp; You have seen me&mdash;me, an innocent
girl! fleeing from a dire catastrophe and haunted by sinister
men; and neither pity, curiosity, nor honour move you to await my
explanation or to help in my distress.&nbsp; Go!&rsquo; she
repeated.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am lost indeed.&rsquo;&nbsp; And with a
passionate gesture she turned and fled along the street.</p>
<p>Challoner observed her retreat and disappear, an almost
intolerable sense of guilt contending with the profound sense
that he was being gulled.&nbsp; She was no sooner gone than the
first of these feelings took the upper hand; he felt, if he had
done her less than justice, that his conduct was a perfect model
of the ungracious; the cultured tone of her voice, her choice of
language, and the elegant decorum of her movements, cried out
aloud against a harsh construction; and between penitence and
curiosity he began slowly to follow in her wake.&nbsp; At the
corner he had her once more full in view.&nbsp; Her speed was
failing like a stricken bird&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Even as he looked,
she threw her arm out gropingly, and fell and leaned against the
wall.&nbsp; At the spectacle, Challoner&rsquo;s fortitude gave
way.&nbsp; In a few strides he overtook her and, for the first
time removing his hat, assured her in the most moving terms of
his entire respect and firm desire to help her.&nbsp; He spoke at
first unheeded; but gradually it appeared that she began to
comprehend his words; she moved a little, and drew herself
upright; and finally, as with a sudden movement of forgiveness,
turned on the young man a countenance in which reproach and
gratitude were mingled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, madam,&rsquo; he cried,
&lsquo;use me as you will!&rsquo;&nbsp; And once more, but now
with a great air of deference, he offered her the conduct of his
arm.&nbsp; She took it with a sigh that struck him to the heart;
and they began once more to trace the deserted streets.&nbsp; But
now her steps, as though exhausted by emotion, began to linger on
the way; she leaned the more heavily upon his arm; and he, like
the parent bird, stooped fondly above his drooping convoy.&nbsp;
Her physical distress was not accompanied by any failing of her
spirits; and hearing her strike so soon into a playful and
charming vein of talk, Challoner could not sufficiently admire
the elasticity of his companion&rsquo;s nature.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let
me forget,&rsquo; she had said, &lsquo;for one half hour, let me
forget;&rsquo; and sure enough, with the very word, her sorrows
appeared to be forgotten.&nbsp; Before every house she paused,
invented a name for the proprietor, and sketched his character:
here lived the old general whom she was to marry on the fifth of
the next month, there was the mansion of the rich widow who had
set her heart on Challoner; and though she still hung wearily on
the young man&rsquo;s arm, her laughter sounded low and pleasant
in his ears.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; she sighed, by way of
commentary, &lsquo;in such a life as mine I must seize tight hold
of any happiness that I can find.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When they arrived, in this leisurely manner, at the head of
Grosvenor Place, the gates of the park were opening and the
bedraggled company of night-walkers were being at last admitted
into that paradise of lawns.&nbsp; Challoner and his companion
followed the movement, and walked for awhile in silence in that
tatterdemalion crowd; but as one after another, weary with the
night&rsquo;s patrolling of the city pavement, sank upon the
benches or wandered into separate paths, the vast extent of the
park had soon utterly swallowed up the last of these intruders;
and the pair proceeded on their way alone in the grateful quiet
of the morning.</p>
<p>Presently they came in sight of a bench, standing very open on
a mound of turf.&nbsp; The young lady looked about her with
relief.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;here at last we are
secure from listeners.&nbsp; Here, then, you shall learn and
judge my history.&nbsp; I could not bear that we should part, and
that you should still suppose your kindness squandered upon one
who was unworthy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon she sat down upon the bench, and motioning Challoner
to take a place immediately beside her, began in the following
words, and with the greatest appearance of enjoyment, to narrate
the story of her life.</p>
<h3><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span><i>STORY OF THE DESTROYING ANGEL</i></h3>
<p>My father was a native of England, son of a cadet of a great,
ancient, but untitled family; and by some event, fault or
misfortune, he was driven to flee from the land of his birth and
to lay aside the name of his ancestors.&nbsp; He sought the
States; and instead of lingering in effeminate cities, pushed at
once into the far West with an exploring party of
frontiersmen.&nbsp; He was no ordinary traveller; for he was not
only brave and impetuous by character, but learned in many
sciences, and above all in botany, which he particularly
loved.&nbsp; Thus it fell that, before many months, Fremont
himself, the nominal leader of the troop, courted and bowed to
his opinion.</p>
<p>They had pushed, as I have said, into the still unknown
regions of the West.&nbsp; For some time they followed the track
of Mormon caravans, guiding themselves in that vast and
melancholy desert by the skeletons of men and animals.&nbsp; Then
they inclined their route a little to the north, and, losing even
these dire memorials, came into a country of forbidding
stillness.</p>
<p>I have often heard my father dwell upon the features of that
ride: rock, cliff, and barren moor alternated; the streams were
very far between; and neither beast nor bird disturbed the
solitude.&nbsp; On the fortieth day they had already run so short
of food that it was judged advisable to call a halt and scatter
upon all sides to hunt.&nbsp; A great fire was built, that its
smoke might serve to rally them; and each man of the party
mounted and struck off at a venture into the surrounding
desert.</p>
<p>My father rode for many hours with a steep range of cliffs
upon the one hand, very black and horrible; and upon the other an
unwatered vale dotted with boulders like the site of some
subverted city.&nbsp; At length he found the slot of a great
animal, and from the claw-marks and the hair among the brush,
judged that he was on the track of a cinnamon bear of most
unusual size.&nbsp; He quickened the pace of his steed, and still
following the quarry, came at last to the division of two
watersheds.&nbsp; On the far side the country was exceeding
intricate and difficult, heaped with boulders, and dotted here
and there with a few pines, which seemed to indicate the
neighbourhood of water.&nbsp; Here, then, he picketed his horse,
and relying on his trusty rifle, advanced alone into that
wilderness.</p>
<p>Presently, in the great silence that reigned, he was aware of
the sound of running water to his right; and leaning in that
direction, was rewarded by a scene of natural wonder and human
pathos strangely intermixed.&nbsp; The stream ran at the bottom
of a narrow and winding passage, whose wall-like sides of rock
were sometimes for miles together unscalable by man.&nbsp; The
water, when the stream was swelled with rains, must have filled
it from side to side; the sun&rsquo;s rays only plumbed it in the
hour of noon; the wind, in that narrow and damp funnel, blew
tempestuously.&nbsp; And yet, in the bottom of this den,
immediately below my father&rsquo;s eyes as he leaned over the
margin of the cliff, a party of some half a hundred men, women,
and children lay scattered uneasily among the rocks.&nbsp; They
lay some upon their backs, some prone, and not one stirring;
their upturned faces seemed all of an extraordinary paleness and
emaciation; and from time to time, above the washing of the
stream, a faint sound of moaning mounted to my father&rsquo;s
ears.</p>
<p>While he thus looked, an old man got staggering to his feet,
unwound his blanket, and laid it, with great gentleness, on a
young girl who sat hard by propped against a rock.&nbsp; The girl
did not seem to be conscious of the act; and the old man, after
having looked upon her with the most engaging pity, returned to
his former bed and lay down again uncovered on the turf.&nbsp;
But the scene had not passed without observation even in that
starving camp.&nbsp; From the very outskirts of the party, a man
with a white beard and seemingly of venerable years, rose upon
his knees, and came crawling stealthily among the sleepers
towards the girl; and judge of my father&rsquo;s indignation,
when he beheld this cowardly miscreant strip from her both the
coverings and return with them to his original position.&nbsp;
Here he lay down for a while below his spoils, and, as my father
imagined, feigned to be asleep; but presently he had raised
himself again upon one elbow, looked with sharp scrutiny at his
companions, and then swiftly carried his hand into his bosom and
thence to his mouth.&nbsp; By the movement of his jaws he must be
eating; in that camp of famine he had reserved a store of
nourishment; and while his companions lay in the stupor of
approaching death, secretly restored his powers.</p>
<p>My father was so incensed at what he saw that he raised his
rifle; and but for an accident, he has often declared, he would
have shot the fellow dead upon the spot.&nbsp; How different
would then have been my history!&nbsp; But it was not to be: even
as he raised the barrel, his eye lighted on the bear, as it
crawled along a ledge some way below him; and ceding to the
hunters instinct, it was at the brute, not at the man, that he
discharged his piece.&nbsp; The bear leaped and fell into a pool
of the river; the canyon re-echoed the report; and in a moment
the camp was afoot.&nbsp; With cries that were scarce human,
stumbling, falling and throwing each other down, these starving
people rushed upon the quarry; and before my father, climbing
down by the ledge, had time to reach the level of the stream,
many were already satisfying their hunger on the raw flesh, and a
fire was being built by the more dainty.</p>
<p>His arrival was for some time unremarked.&nbsp; He stood in
the midst of these tottering and clay-faced marionettes; he was
surrounded by their cries; but their whole soul was fixed on the
dead carcass; even those who were too weak to move, lay,
half-turned over, with their eyes riveted upon the bear; and my
father, seeing himself stand as though invisible in the thick of
this dreary hubbub, was seized with a desire to weep.&nbsp; A
touch upon the arm restrained him.&nbsp; Turning about, he found
himself face to face with the old man he had so nearly killed;
and yet, at the second glance, recognised him for no old man at
all, but one in the full strength of his years, and of a strong,
speaking, and intellectual countenance stigmatised by weariness
and famine.&nbsp; He beckoned my father near the cliff, and
there, in the most private whisper, begged for brandy.&nbsp; My
father looked at him with scorn: &lsquo;You remind me,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;of a neglected duty.&nbsp; Here is my flask; it
contains enough, I trust, to revive the women of your party; and
I will begin with her whom I saw you robbing of her
blankets.&rsquo;&nbsp; And with that, not heeding his appeals, my
father turned his back upon the egoist.</p>
<p>The girl still lay reclined against the rock; she lay too far
sunk in the first stage of death to have observed the bustle
round her couch; but when my father had raised her head, put the
flask to her lips, and forced or aided her to swallow some drops
of the restorative, she opened her languid eyes and smiled upon
him faintly.&nbsp; Never was there a smile of a more touching
sweetness; never were eyes more deeply violet, more honestly
eloquent of the soul!&nbsp; I speak with knowledge, for these
were the same eyes that smiled upon me in the cradle.&nbsp; From
her who was to be his wife, my father, still jealously watched
and followed by the man with the grey beard, carried his
attentions to all the women of the party, and gave the last
drainings of his flask to those among the men who seemed in the
most need.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there none left? not a drop for me?&rsquo; said the
man with the beard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not one drop,&rsquo; replied my father; &lsquo;and if
you find yourself in want, let me counsel you to put your hand
into the pocket of your coat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried the other, &lsquo;you misjudge
me.&nbsp; You think me one who clings to life for selfish and
commonplace considerations.&nbsp; But let me tell you, that were
all this caravan to perish, the world would but be lightened of a
weight.&nbsp; These are but human insects, pullulating, thick as
May-flies, in the slums of European cities, whom I myself have
plucked from degradation and misery, from the dung-heap and
gin-palace door.&nbsp; And you compare their lives with
mine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are then a Mormon missionary?&rsquo; asked my
father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried the man, with a strange smile,
&lsquo;a Mormon missionary if you will!&nbsp; I value not the
title.&nbsp; Were I no more than that, I could have died without
a murmur.&nbsp; But with my life as a physician is bound up the
knowledge of great secrets and the future of man.&nbsp; This it
was, when we missed the caravan, tried for a short cut and
wandered to this desolate ravine, that ate into my soul, and, in
five days, has changed my beard from ebony to silver.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you are a physician,&rsquo; mused my father,
looking on his face, &lsquo;bound by oath to succour man in his
distresses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; returned the Mormon, &lsquo;my name is
Grierson: you will hear that name again; and you will then
understand that my duty was not to this caravan of paupers, but
to mankind at large.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My father turned to the remainder of the party, who were now
sufficiently revived to hear; told them that he would set off at
once to bring help from his own party; &lsquo;and,&rsquo; he
added, &lsquo;if you be again reduced to such extremities, look
round you, and you will see the earth strewn with
assistance.&nbsp; Here, for instance, growing on the under side
of fissures in this cliff, you will perceive a yellow moss.&nbsp;
Trust me, it is both edible and excellent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; said Doctor Grierson, &lsquo;you know
botany!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not I alone,&rsquo; returned my father, lowering his
voice; &lsquo;for see where these have been scraped away.&nbsp;
Am I right?&nbsp; Was that your secret store?&rsquo;</p>
<p>My father&rsquo;s comrades, he found, when he returned to the
signal-fire, had made a good day&rsquo;s hunting.&nbsp; They were
thus the more easily persuaded to extend assistance to the Mormon
caravan; and the next day beheld both parties on the march for
the frontiers of Utah.&nbsp; The distance to be traversed was not
great; but the nature of the country, and the difficulty of
procuring food, extended the time to nearly three weeks; and my
father had thus ample leisure to know and appreciate the girl
whom he had succoured.&nbsp; I will call my mother Lucy.&nbsp;
Her family name I am not at liberty to mention; it is one you
would know well.&nbsp; By what series of undeserved calamities
this innocent flower of maidenhood, lovely, refined by education,
ennobled by the finest taste, was thus cast among the horrors of
a Mormon caravan, I must not stay to tell you.&nbsp; Let it
suffice, that even in these untoward circumstances, she found a
heart worthy of her own.&nbsp; The ardour of attachment which
united my father and mother was perhaps partly due to the strange
manner of their meeting; it knew, at least, no bounds either
divine or human; my father, for her sake, determined to renounce
his ambitions and abjure his faith; and a week had not yet passed
upon the march before he had resigned from his party, accepted
the Mormon doctrine, and received the promise of my
mother&rsquo;s hand on the arrival of the party at Salt Lake.</p>
<p>The marriage took place, and I was its only offspring.&nbsp;
My father prospered exceedingly in his affairs, remained faithful
to my mother; and though you may wonder to hear it, I believe
there were few happier homes in any country than that in which I
saw the light and grew to girlhood.&nbsp; We were, indeed, and in
spite of all our wealth, avoided as heretics and half-believers
by the more precise and pious of the faithful: Young himself,
that formidable tyrant, was known to look askance upon my
father&rsquo;s riches; but of this I had no guess.&nbsp; I dwelt,
indeed, under the Mormon system, with perfect innocence and
faith.&nbsp; Some of our friends had many wives; but such was the
custom; and why should it surprise me more than marriage
itself?&nbsp; From time to time one of our rich acquaintances
would disappear, his family be broken up, his wives and houses
shared among the elders of the Church, and his memory only
recalled with bated breath and dreadful headshakings.&nbsp; When
I had been very still, and my presence perhaps was forgotten,
some such topic would arise among my elders by the evening fire;
I would see them draw the closer together and look behind them
with scared eyes; and I might gather from their whisperings how
some one, rich, honoured, healthy, and in the prime of his days,
some one, perhaps, who had taken me on his knees a week before,
had in one hour been spirited from home and family, and vanished
like an image from a mirror, leaving not a print behind.&nbsp; It
was terrible, indeed; but so was death, the universal law.&nbsp;
And even if the talk should wax still bolder, full of ominous
silences and nods, and I should hear named in a whisper the
Destroying Angels, how was a child to understand these
mysteries?&nbsp; I heard of a Destroying Angel as some more happy
child might hear in England of a bishop or a rural dean, with
vague respect and without the wish for further information.&nbsp;
Life anywhere, in society as in nature, rests upon dread
foundations; I beheld safe roads, a garden blooming in the
desert, pious people crowding to worship; I was aware of my
parents&rsquo; tenderness and all the harmless luxuries of my
existence; and why should I pry beneath this honest seeming
surface for the mysteries on which it stood?</p>
<p>We dwelt originally in the city; but at an early date we moved
to a beautiful house in a green dingle, musical with splashing
water, and surrounded on almost every side by twenty miles of
poisonous and rocky desert.&nbsp; The city was thirty miles away;
there was but one road, which went no further than my
father&rsquo;s door; the rest were bridle-tracks impassable in
winter; and we thus dwelt in a solitude inconceivable to the
European.&nbsp; Our only neighbour was Dr. Grierson.&nbsp; To my
young eyes, after the hair-oiled, chin-bearded elders of the
city, and the ill-favoured and mentally stunted women of their
harems, there was something agreeable in the correct manner, the
fine bearing, the thin white hair and beard, and the piercing
looks of the old doctor.&nbsp; Yet, though he was almost our only
visitor, I never wholly overcame a sense of fear in his presence;
and this disquietude was rather fed by the awful solitude in
which he lived and the obscurity that hung about his
occupations.&nbsp; His house was but a mile or two from ours, but
very differently placed.&nbsp; It stood overlooking the road on
the summit of a steep slope, and planted close against a range of
overhanging bluffs.&nbsp; Nature, you would say, had here desired
to imitate the works of man; for the slope was even, like the
glacis of a fort, and the cliffs of a constant height, like the
ramparts of a city.&nbsp; Not even spring could change one
feature of that desolate scene; and the windows looked down
across a plain, snowy with alkali, to ranges of cold stone
sierras on the north.&nbsp; Twice or thrice I remember passing
within view of this forbidding residence; and seeing it always
shuttered, smokeless, and deserted, I remarked to my parents that
some day it would certainly be robbed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, no,&rsquo; said my father, &lsquo;never
robbed;&rsquo; and I observed a strange conviction in his
tone.</p>
<p>At last, and not long before the blow fell on my unhappy
family, I chanced to see the doctor&rsquo;s house in a new
light.&nbsp; My father was ill; my mother confined to his
bedside; and I was suffered to go, under the charge of our
driver, to the lonely house some twenty miles away, where our
packages were left for us.&nbsp; The horse cast a shoe; night
overtook us halfway home; and it was well on for three in the
morning when the driver and I, alone in a light waggon, came to
that part of the road which ran below the doctor&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; The moon swam clear; the cliffs and mountains in
this strong light lay utterly deserted; but the house, from its
station on the top of the long slope and close under the bluff,
not only shone abroad from every window like a place of festival,
but from the great chimney at the west end poured forth a coil of
smoke so thick and so voluminous, that it hung for miles along
the windless night air, and its shadow lay far abroad in the
moonlight upon the glittering alkali.&nbsp; As we continued to
draw near, besides, a regular and panting throb began to divide
the silence.&nbsp; First it seemed to me like the beating of a
heart; and next it put into my mind the thought of some giant,
smothered under mountains and still, with incalculable effort,
fetching breath.&nbsp; I had heard of the railway, though I had
not seen it, and I turned to ask the driver if this resembled
it.&nbsp; But some look in his eye, some pallor, whether of fear
or moonlight on his face, caused the words to die upon my
lips.&nbsp; We continued, therefore, to advance in silence, till
we were close below the lighted house; when suddenly, without one
premonitory rustle, there burst forth a report of such a bigness
that it shook the earth and set the echoes of the mountains
thundering from cliff to cliff.&nbsp; A pillar of amber flame
leaped from the chimney-top and fell in multitudes of sparks; and
at the same time the lights in the windows turned for one instant
ruby red and then expired.&nbsp; The driver had checked his horse
instinctively, and the echoes were still rumbling farther off
among the mountains, when there broke from the now darkened
interior a series of yells&mdash;whether of man or woman it was
impossible to guess&mdash;the door flew open, and there ran forth
into the moonlight, at the top of the long slope, a figure clad
in white, which began to dance and leap and throw itself down,
and roll as if in agony, before the house.&nbsp; I could no more
restrain my cries; the driver laid his lash about the
horse&rsquo;s flank, and we fled up the rough track at the peril
of our lives; and did not draw rein till, turning the corner of
the mountain, we beheld my father&rsquo;s ranch and deep, green
groves and gardens, sleeping in the tranquil light.</p>
<p>This was the one adventure of my life, until my father had
climbed to the very topmost point of material prosperity, and I
myself had reached the age of seventeen.&nbsp; I was still
innocent and merry like a child; tended my garden or ran upon the
hills in glad simplicity; gave not a thought to coquetry or to
material cares; and if my eye rested on my own image in a mirror
or some sylvan spring, it was to seek and recognise the features
of my parents.&nbsp; But the fears which had long pressed on
others were now to be laid on my youth.&nbsp; I had thrown
myself, one sultry, cloudy afternoon, on a divan; the windows
stood open on the verandah, where my mother sat with her
embroidery; and when my father joined her from the garden, their
conversation, clearly audible to me, was of so startling a nature
that it held me enthralled where I lay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The blow has come,&rsquo; my father said, after a long
pause.</p>
<p>I could hear my mother start and turn, but in words she made
no reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; continued my father, &lsquo;I have received
to-day a list of all that I possess; of all, I say; of what I
have lent privately to men whose lips are sealed with terror; of
what I have buried with my own hand on the bare mountain, when
there was not a bird in heaven.&nbsp; Does the air, then, carry
secrets?&nbsp; Are the hills of glass?&nbsp; Do the stones we
tread upon preserve the footprint to betray us?&nbsp; Oh, Lucy,
Lucy, that we should have come to such a country!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But this,&rsquo; returned my mother, &lsquo;is no very
new or very threatening event.&nbsp; You are accused of some
concealment.&nbsp; You will pay more taxes in the future, and be
mulcted in a fine.&nbsp; It is disquieting, indeed, to find our
acts so spied upon, and the most private known.&nbsp; But is this
new?&nbsp; Have we not long feared and suspected every blade of
grass?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, and our shadows!&rsquo; cried my father.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But all this is nothing.&nbsp; Here is the letter that
accompanied the list.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I heard my mother turn the pages, and she was some time
silent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; she said at last; and then, with the tone
of one reading: &lsquo;&ldquo;From a believer so largely blessed
by Providence with this world&rsquo;s goods,&rdquo;&rsquo; she
continued, &lsquo;&ldquo;the Church awaits in confidence some
signal mark of piety.&rdquo;&nbsp; There lies the sting.&nbsp; Am
I not right?&nbsp; These are the words you fear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;These are the words,&rsquo; replied my father.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Lucy, you remember Priestley?&nbsp; Two days before he
disappeared, he carried me to the summit of an isolated butte; we
could see around us for ten miles; sure, if in any quarter of
this land a man were safe from spies, it were in such a station;
but it was in the very ague-fit of terror that he told me, and
that I heard, his story.&nbsp; He had received a letter such as
this; and he submitted to my approval an answer, in which he
offered to resign a third of his possessions.&nbsp; I conjured
him, as he valued life, to raise his offering; and, before we
parted, he had doubled the amount.&nbsp; Well, two days later he
was gone&mdash;gone from the chief street of the city in the hour
of noon&mdash;and gone for ever.&nbsp; O God!&rsquo; cried my
father, &lsquo;by what art do they thus spirit out of life the
solid body?&nbsp; What death do they command that leaves no
traces? that this material structure, these strong arms, this
skeleton that can resist the grave for centuries, should be thus
reft in a moment from the world of sense?&nbsp; A horror dwells
in that thought more awful than mere death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there no hope in Grierson?&rsquo; asked my
mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dismiss the thought,&rsquo; replied my father.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He now knows all that I can teach, and will do naught to
save me.&nbsp; His power, besides, is small, his own danger not
improbably more imminent than mine; for he, too, lives apart; he
leaves his wives neglected and unwatched; he is openly cited for
an unbeliever; and unless he buys security at a more awful
price&mdash;but no; I will not believe it: I have no love for
him, but I will not believe it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Believe what?&rsquo; asked my mother; and then, with a
change of note, &lsquo;But oh, what matters it?&rsquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Abimelech, there is but one way open: we must
fly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is in vain,&rsquo; returned my father.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I should but involve you in my fate.&nbsp; To leave this
land is hopeless: we are closed in it as men are closed in life;
and there is no issue but the grave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can but die then,&rsquo; replied my mother.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Let us at least die together.&nbsp; Let not Asenath <a
name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a> and myself survive you.&nbsp; Think to
what a fate we should be doomed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>My father was unable to resist her tender violence; and though
I could see he nourished not one spark of hope, he consented to
desert his whole estate, beyond some hundreds of dollars that he
had by him at the moment, and to flee that night, which promised
to be dark and cloudy.&nbsp; As soon as the servants were asleep,
he was to load two mules with provisions; two others were to
carry my mother and myself; and, striking through the mountains
by an unfrequented trail, we were to make a fair stroke for
liberty and life.&nbsp; As soon as they had thus decided, I
showed myself at the window, and, owning that I had heard all,
assured them that they could rely on my prudence and
devotion.&nbsp; I had no fear, indeed, but to show myself
unworthy of my birth; I held my life in my hand without alarm;
and when my father, weeping upon my neck, had blessed Heaven for
the courage of his child, it was with a sentiment of pride and
some of the joy that warriors take in war, that I began to look
forward to the perils of our flight.</p>
<p>Before midnight, under an obscure and starless heaven, we had
left far behind us the plantations of the valley, and were
mounting a certain canyon in the hills, narrow, encumbered with
great rocks, and echoing with the roar of a tumultuous
torrent.&nbsp; Cascade after cascade thundered and hung up its
flag of whiteness in the night, or fanned our faces with the wet
wind of its descent.&nbsp; The trail was breakneck, and led to
famine-guarded deserts; it had been long since deserted for more
practicable routes; and it was now a part of the world untrod
from year to year by human footing. Judge of our dismay, when
turning suddenly an angle of the cliffs, we found a bright
bonfire blazing by itself under an impending rock; and on the
face of the rock, drawn very rudely with charred wood, the great
Open Eye which is the emblem of the Mormon faith.&nbsp; We looked
upon each other in the firelight; my mother broke into a passion
of tears; but not a word was said.&nbsp; The mules were turned
about; and leaving that great eye to guard the lonely canyon, we
retraced our steps in silence.&nbsp; Day had not yet broken ere
we were once more at home, condemned beyond reprieve.</p>
<p>What answer my father sent I was not told; but two days later,
a little before sundown, I saw a plain, honest-looking man ride
slowly up the road in a great pother of dust.&nbsp; He was clad
in homespun, with a broad straw hat; wore a patriarchal beard;
and had an air of a simple rustic farmer, that was, in my eyes,
very reassuring.&nbsp; He was, indeed, a very honest man and
pious Mormon; with no liking for his errand, though neither he
nor any one in Utah dared to disobey; and it was with every mark
of diffidence that he had had himself announced as Mr. Aspinwall,
and entered the room where our unhappy family was gathered.&nbsp;
My mother and me, he awkwardly enough dismissed; and as soon as
he was alone with my father laid before him a blank signature of
President Young&rsquo;s, and offered him a choice of services:
either to set out as a missionary to the tribes about the White
Sea, or to join the next day, with a party of Destroying Angels,
in the massacre of sixty German immigrants.&nbsp; The last, of
course, my father could not entertain, and the first he regarded
as a pretext: even if he could consent to leave his wife
defenceless, and to collect fresh victims for the tyranny under
which he was himself oppressed, he felt sure he would never be
suffered to return.&nbsp; He refused both; and Aspinwall, he
said, betrayed sincere emotion, part religious, at the spectacle
of such disobedience, but part human, in pity for my father and
his family.&nbsp; He besought him to reconsider his decision; and
at length, finding he could not prevail, gave him till the moon
rose to settle his affairs, and say farewell to wife and
daughter.&nbsp; &lsquo;For,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;then, at the
latest, you must ride with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I dare not dwell upon the hours that followed: they fled all
too fast; and presently the moon out-topped the eastern range,
and my father and Mr. Aspinwall set forth, side by side, on their
nocturnal journey.&nbsp; My mother, though still bearing an
heroic countenance, had hastened to shut herself in her
apartment, thenceforward solitary; and I, alone in the dark
house, and consumed by grief and apprehension, made haste to
saddle my Indian pony, to ride up to the corner of the mountain,
and to enjoy one farewell sight of my departing father.&nbsp; The
two men had set forth at a deliberate pace; nor was I long behind
them, when I reached the point of view.&nbsp; I was the more
amazed to see no moving creature in the landscape.&nbsp; The
moon, as the saying is, shone bright as day; and nowhere, under
the whole arch of night, was there a growing tree, a bush, a
farm, a patch of tillage, or any evidence of man, but one.&nbsp;
From the corner where I stood, a rugged bastion of the line of
bluffs concealed the doctor&rsquo;s house; and across the top of
that projection the soft night wind carried and unwound about the
hills a coil of sable smoke.&nbsp; What fuel could produce a
vapour so sluggish to dissipate in that dry air, or what furnace
pour it forth so copiously, I was unable to conceive; but I knew
well enough that it came from the doctor&rsquo;s chimney; I saw
well enough that my father had already disappeared; and in
despite of reason, I connected in my mind the loss of that dear
protector with the ribbon of foul smoke that trailed along the
mountains.</p>
<p>Days passed, and still my mother and I waited in vain for
news; a week went by, a second followed, but we heard no word of
the father and husband.&nbsp; As smoke dissipates, as the image
glides from the mirror, so in the ten or twenty minutes that I
had spent in getting my horse and following upon his trail, had
that strong and brave man vanished out of life.&nbsp; Hope, if
any hope we had, fled with every hour; the worst was now certain
for my father, the worst was to be dreaded for his defenceless
family.&nbsp; Without weakness, with a desperate calm at which I
marvel when I look back upon it, the widow and the orphan awaited
the event.&nbsp; On the last day of the third week we rose in the
morning to find ourselves alone in the house, alone, so far as we
searched, on the estate; all our attendants, with one accord, had
fled: and as we knew them to be gratefully devoted, we drew the
darkest intimations from their flight.&nbsp; The day passed,
indeed, without event; but in the fall of the evening we were
called at last into the verandah by the approaching clink of
horse&rsquo;s hoofs.</p>
<p>The doctor, mounted on an Indian pony, rode into the garden,
dismounted, and saluted us.&nbsp; He seemed much more bent, and
his hair more silvery than ever; but his demeanour was composed,
serious, and not unkind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I am come upon a weighty
errand; and I would have you recognise it as an effect of
kindness in the President, that he should send as his ambassador
your only neighbour and your husband&rsquo;s oldest friend in
Utah.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said my mother, &lsquo;I have but one
concern, one thought.&nbsp; You know well what it is.&nbsp;
Speak: my husband?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; returned the doctor, taking a chair on
the verandah, &lsquo;if you were a silly child, my position would
now be painfully embarrassing.&nbsp; You are, on the other hand,
a woman of great intelligence and fortitude: you have, by my
forethought, been allowed three weeks to draw your own
conclusions and to accept the inevitable.&nbsp; Farther words
from me are, I conceive, superfluous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My mother was as pale as death, and trembled like a reed; I
gave her my hand, and she kept it in the folds of her dress and
wrung it till I could have cried aloud.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then,
sir,&rsquo; said she at last, &lsquo;you speak to deaf
ears.&nbsp; If this be indeed so, what have I to do with
errands?&nbsp; What do I ask of Heaven but to die?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said the doctor, &lsquo;command
yourself.&nbsp; I bid you dismiss all thoughts of your late
husband, and bring a clear mind to bear upon your own future and
the fate of that young girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You bid me dismiss&mdash;&rsquo; began my mother.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Then you know!&rsquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know,&rsquo; replied the doctor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know?&rsquo; broke out the poor woman.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Then it was you who did the deed!&nbsp; I tear off the
mask, and with dread and loathing see you as you are&mdash;you,
whom the poor fugitive beholds in nightmares, and awakes
raving&mdash;you, the Destroying Angel!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, madam, and what then?&rsquo; returned the
doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have not my fate and yours been
similar?&nbsp; Are we not both immured in this strong prison of
Utah?&nbsp; Have you not tried to flee, and did not the Open Eye
confront you in the canyon?&nbsp; Who can escape the watch of
that unsleeping eye of Utah?&nbsp; Not I, at least.&nbsp;
Horrible tasks have, indeed, been laid upon me; and the most
ungrateful was the last; but had I refused my offices, would that
have spared your husband?&nbsp; You know well it would not.&nbsp;
I, too, had perished along with him; nor would I have been able
to alleviate his last moments, nor could I to-day have stood
between his family and the hand of Brigham Young.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried I, &lsquo;and could you purchase life
by such concessions?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Young lady,&rsquo; answered the doctor, &lsquo;I both
could and did; and you will live to thank me for that
baseness.&nbsp; You have a spirit, Asenath, that it pleases me to
recognise.&nbsp; But we waste time.&nbsp; Mr. Fonblanque&rsquo;s
estate reverts, as you doubtless imagine, to the Church; but some
part of it has been reserved for him who is to marry the family;
and that person, I should perhaps tell you without more delay, is
no other than myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this odious proposal my mother and I cried out aloud, and
clung together like lost souls.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is as I supposed,&rsquo; resumed the doctor, with
the same measured utterance.&nbsp; &lsquo;You recoil from this
arrangement.&nbsp; Do you expect me to convince you?&nbsp; You
know very well that I have never held the Mormon view of
women.&nbsp; Absorbed in the most arduous studies, I have left
the slatterns whom they call my wives to scratch and quarrel
among themselves; of me, they have had nothing but my purse; such
was not the union I desired, even if I had the leisure to pursue
it.&nbsp; No: you need not, madam, and my old
friend&rsquo;&mdash;and here the doctor rose and bowed with
something of gallantry&mdash;&lsquo;you need not apprehend my
importunities.&nbsp; On the contrary, I am rejoiced to read in
you a Roman spirit; and if I am obliged to bid you follow me at
once, and that in the name, not of my wish, but of my orders, I
hope it will be found that we are of a common mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So, bidding us dress for the road, he took a lamp (for the
night had now fallen) and set off to the stable to prepare our
horses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does it mean?&mdash;what will become of us?&rsquo;
I cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not that, at least,&rsquo; replied my mother,
shuddering.&nbsp; &lsquo;So far we can trust him.&nbsp; I seem to
read among his words a certain tragic promise.&nbsp; Asenath, if
I leave you, if I die, you will not forget your miserable
parents?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon we fell to cross-purposes: I beseeching her to
explain her words; she putting me by, and continuing to recommend
the doctor for a friend.&nbsp; &lsquo;The doctor!&rsquo; I cried
at last; &lsquo;the man who killed my father?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;let us be just.&nbsp; I do
believe before, Heaven, he played the friendliest part.&nbsp; And
he alone, Asenath, can protect you in this land of
death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this the doctor returned, leading our two horses; and when
we were all in the saddle, he bade me ride on before, as he had
matter to discuss with Mrs. Fonblanque.&nbsp; They came at a
foot&rsquo;s pace, eagerly conversing in a whisper; and presently
after the moon rose and showed them looking eagerly in each
other&rsquo;s faces as they went, my mother laying her hand upon
the doctor&rsquo;s arm, and the doctor himself, against his usual
custom, making vigorous gestures of protest or asseveration.</p>
<p>At the foot of the track which ascended the talus of the
mountain to his door, the doctor overtook me at a trot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;we shall dismount; and as
your mother prefers to be alone, you and I shall walk together to
my house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I see her again?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I give you my word,&rsquo; he said, and helped me to
alight.&nbsp; &lsquo;We leave the horses here,&rsquo; he
added.&nbsp; &lsquo;There are no thieves in this stone
wilderness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The track mounted gradually, keeping the house in view.&nbsp;
The windows were once more bright; the chimney once more vomited
smoke; but the most absolute silence reigned, and, but for the
figure of my mother very slowly following in our wake, I felt
convinced there was no human soul within a range of miles.&nbsp;
At the thought, I looked upon the doctor, gravely walking by my
side, with his bowed shoulders and white hair, and then once more
at his house, lit up and pouring smoke like some industrious
factory.&nbsp; And then my curiosity broke forth.&nbsp; &lsquo;In
Heaven&rsquo;s name,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;what do you make in
this inhuman desert?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me with a peculiar smile, and answered with an
evasion&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is not the first time,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that
you have seen my furnaces alight.&nbsp; One morning, in the small
hours, I saw you driving past; a delicate experiment miscarried;
and I cannot acquit myself of having startled either your driver
or the horse that drew you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; cried I, beholding again in fancy the
antics of the figure, &lsquo;could that be you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was I,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;but do not fancy
that I was mad.&nbsp; I was in agony.&nbsp; I had been scalded
cruelly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We were now near the house, which, unlike the ordinary houses
of the country, was built of hewn stone and very solid.&nbsp;
Stone, too, was its foundation, stone its background.&nbsp; Not a
blade of grass sprouted among the broken mineral about the walls,
not a flower adorned the windows.&nbsp; Over the door, by way of
sole adornment, the Mormon Eye was rudely sculptured; I had been
brought up to view that emblem from my childhood; but since the
night of our escape, it had acquired a new significance, and set
me shrinking.&nbsp; The smoke rolled voluminously from the
chimney top, its edges ruddy with the fire; and from the far
corner of the building, near the ground, angry puffs of steam
shone snow-white in the moon and vanished.</p>
<p>The doctor opened the door and paused upon the
threshold.&nbsp; &lsquo;You ask me what I make here,&rsquo; he
observed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Two things: Life and Death.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And he motioned me to enter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall await my mother,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Child,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;look at me: am I not
old and broken?&nbsp; Of us two, which is the stronger, the young
maiden or the withered man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I bowed, and passing by him, entered a vestibule or kitchen,
lit by a good fire and a shaded reading-lamp.&nbsp; It was
furnished only with a dresser, a rude table, and some wooden
benches; and on one of these the doctor motioned me to take a
seat; and passing by another door into the interior of the house,
he left me to myself.&nbsp; Presently I heard the jar of iron
from the far end of the building; and this was followed by the
same throbbing noise that had startled me in the valley, but now
so near at hand as to be menacing by loudness, and even to shake
the house with every recurrence of the stroke.&nbsp; I had scarce
time to master my alarm when the doctor returned, and almost in
the same moment my mother appeared upon the threshold.&nbsp; But
how am I to describe to you the peace and ravishment of that
face?&nbsp; Years seemed to have passed over her head during that
brief ride, and left her younger and fairer; her eyes shone, her
smile went to my heart; she seemed no more a woman but the angel
of ecstatic tenderness.&nbsp; I ran to her in a kind of terror;
but she shrank a little back and laid her finger on her lips,
with something arch and yet unearthly.&nbsp; To the doctor, on
the contrary, she reached out her hand as to a friend and helper;
and so strange was the scene that I forgot to be offended.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy,&rsquo; said the doctor, &lsquo;all is
prepared.&nbsp; Will you go alone, or shall your daughter follow
us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let Asenath come,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;dear
Asenath!&nbsp; At this hour, when I am purified of fear and
sorrow, and already survive myself and my affections, it is for
your sake, and not for mine, that I desire her presence.&nbsp;
Were she shut out, dear friend, it is to be feared she might
misjudge your kindness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; I cried wildly, &lsquo;mother, what is
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But my mother, with her radiant smile, said only
&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; as though I were a child again, and tossing
in some fever-fit; and the doctor bade me be silent and trouble
her no more.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have made a choice,&rsquo; he
continued, addressing my mother, &lsquo;that has often strangely
tempted me.&nbsp; The two extremes: all, or else nothing; never,
or this very hour upon the clock&mdash;these have been my
incongruous desires.&nbsp; But to accept the middle term, to be
content with a half-gift, to flicker awhile and to burn
out&mdash;never for an hour, never since I was born, has
satisfied the appetite of my ambition.&rsquo;&nbsp; He looked
upon my mother fixedly, much of admiration and some touch of envy
in his eyes; then, with a profound sigh, he led the way into the
inner room.</p>
<p>It was very long.&nbsp; From end to end it was lit up by many
lamps, which by the changeful colour of their light, and by the
incessant snapping sounds with which they burned, I have since
divined to be electric.&nbsp; At the extreme end an open door
gave us a glimpse into what must have been a lean-to shed beside
the chimney; and this, in strong contrast to the room, was
painted with a red reverberation as from furnace-doors.&nbsp; The
walls were lined with books and glazed cases, the tables crowded
with the implements of chemical research; great glass
accumulators glittered in the light; and through a hole in the
gable near the shed door, a heavy driving-belt entered the
apartment and ran overhead upon steel pulleys, with clumsy
activity and many ghostly and fluttering sounds.&nbsp; In one
corner I perceived a chair resting upon crystal feet, and
curiously wreathed with wire.&nbsp; To this my mother advanced
with a decisive swiftness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this it?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>The doctor bowed in silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Asenath,&rsquo; said my mother, &lsquo;in this sad end
of my life I have found one helper.&nbsp; Look upon him: it is
Doctor Grierson.&nbsp; Be not, oh my daughter, be not ungrateful
to that friend!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She sate upon the chair, and took in her hands the globes that
terminated the arms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Am I right?&rsquo; she asked, and looked upon the
doctor with such a radiancy of face that I trembled for her
reason.&nbsp; Once more the doctor bowed, but this time leaning
hard against the wall.&nbsp; He must have touched a spring.&nbsp;
The least shock agitated my mother where she sat; the least
passing jar appeared to cross her features; and she sank back in
the chair like one resigned to weariness.&nbsp; I was at her
knees that moment; but her hands fell loosely in my grasp; her
face, still beatified with the same touching smile, sank forward
on her bosom: her spirit had for ever fled.</p>
<p>I do not know how long may have elapsed before, raising for a
moment my tearful face, I met the doctor&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; They
rested upon mine with such a depth of scrutiny, pity, and
interest, that even from the freshness of my sorrow, I was
startled into attention.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Enough,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to lamentation.&nbsp;
Your mother went to death as to a bridal, dying where her husband
died.&nbsp; It is time, Asenath, to think of the survivors.&nbsp;
Follow me to the next room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I followed him, like a person in a dream; he made me sit by
the fire, he gave me wine to drink; and then, pacing the stone
floor, he thus began to address me&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are now, my child, alone in the world, and under
the immediate watch of Brigham Young.&nbsp; It would be your lot,
in ordinary circumstances, to become the fiftieth bride of some
ignoble elder, or by particular fortune, as fortune is counted in
this land, to find favour in the eyes of the President
himself.&nbsp; Such a fate for a girl like you were worse than
death; better to die as your mother died than to sink daily
deeper in the mire of this pit of woman&rsquo;s
degradation.&nbsp; But is escape conceivable?&nbsp; Your father
tried; and you beheld yourself with what security his jailers
acted, and how a dumb drawing on a rock was counted a sufficient
sentry over the avenues of freedom.&nbsp; Where your father
failed, will you be wiser or more fortunate? or are you, too,
helpless in the toils?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had followed his words with changing emotion, but now I
believed I understood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; I cried; &lsquo;you judge me
rightly.&nbsp; I must follow where my parents led; and oh! I am
not only willing, I am eager!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the doctor, &lsquo;not death for
you.&nbsp; The flawed vessel we may break, but not the
perfect.&nbsp; No, your mother cherished a different hope, and so
do I.&nbsp; I see,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;the girl develop to
the completed woman, the plan reach fulfilment, the
promise&mdash;ay, outdone!&nbsp; I could not bear to arrest so
lively, so comely a process.&nbsp; It was your mother&rsquo;s
thought,&rsquo; he added, with a change of tone, &lsquo;that I
should marry you myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; I fear I must have shown a
perfect horror of aversion from this fate, for he made haste to
quiet me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Reassure yourself, Asenath,&rsquo; he
resumed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Old as I am, I have not forgotten the
tumultuous fancies of youth.&nbsp; I have passed my days, indeed,
in laboratories; but in all my vigils I have not forgotten the
tune of a young pulse.&nbsp; Age asks with timidity to be spared
intolerable pain; youth, taking fortune by the beard, demands joy
like a right.&nbsp; These things I have not forgotten; none,
rather, has more keenly felt, none more jealously considered
them; I have but postponed them to their day.&nbsp; See, then:
you stand without support; the only friend left to you, this old
investigator, old in cunning, young in sympathy.&nbsp; Answer me
but one question: Are you free from the entanglement of what the
world calls love?&nbsp; Do you still command your heart and
purposes? or are you fallen in some bond-slavery of the eye and
ear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I answered him in broken words; my heart, I think I must have
told him, lay with my dead parents.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is enough,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It has been
my fate to be called on often, too often, for those services of
which we spoke to-night; none in Utah could carry them so well to
a conclusion; hence there has fallen into my hands a certain
share of influence which I now lay at your service, partly for
the sake of my dead friends, your parents; partly for the
interest I bear you in your own right.&nbsp; I shall send you to
England, to the great city of London, there to await the
bridegroom I have selected.&nbsp; He shall be a son of mine, a
young man suitable in age and not grossly deficient in that
quality of beauty that your years demand.&nbsp; Since your heart
is free, you may well pledge me the sole promise that I ask in
return for much expense and still more danger: to await the
arrival of that bridegroom with the delicacy of a
wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I sat awhile stunned.&nbsp; The doctor&rsquo;s marriages, I
remembered to have heard, had been unfruitful; and this added
perplexity to my distress.&nbsp; But I was alone, as he had said,
alone in that dark land; the thought of escape, of any equal
marriage, was already enough to revive in me some dawn of hope;
and in what words I know not, I accepted the proposal.</p>
<p>He seemed more moved by my consent than I could reasonably
have looked for.&nbsp; &lsquo;You shall see,&rsquo; he cried;
&lsquo;you shall judge for yourself.&rsquo;&nbsp; And hurrying to
the next room he returned with a small portrait somewhat coarsely
done in oils.&nbsp; It showed a man in the dress of nearly forty
years before, young indeed, but still recognisable to be the
doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you like it?&rsquo; he asked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That is myself when I was young.&nbsp; My&mdash;my boy
will be like that, like but nobler; with such health as angels
might condescend to envy; and a man of mind, Asenath, of
commanding mind.&nbsp; That should be a man, I think; that should
be one among ten thousand.&nbsp; A man like that&mdash;one to
combine the passions of youth with the restraint, the force, the
dignity of age&mdash;one to fill all the parts and faculties, one
to be man&rsquo;s epitome&mdash;say, will that not satisfy the
needs of an ambitious girl?&nbsp; Say, is not that
enough?&rsquo;&nbsp; And as he held the picture close before my
eyes, his hands shook.</p>
<p>I told him briefly I would ask no better, for I was
transpierced with this display of fatherly emotion; but even as I
said the words, the most insolent revolt surged through my
arteries.&nbsp; I held him in horror, him, his portrait, and his
son; and had there been any choice but death or a Mormon
marriage, I declare before Heaven I had embraced it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is well,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;and I had rightly
counted on your spirit.&nbsp; Eat, then, for you have far to
go.&rsquo;&nbsp; So saying, he set meat before me; and while I
was endeavouring to obey, he left the room and returned with an
armful of coarse raiment.&nbsp; &lsquo;There,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;is your disguise.&nbsp; I leave you to your
toilet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The clothes had probably belonged to a somewhat lubberly boy
of fifteen; and they hung about me like a sack, and cruelly
hampered my movements.&nbsp; But what filled me with
uncontrollable shudderings, was the problem of their origin and
the fate of the lad to whom they had belonged.&nbsp; I had
scarcely effected the exchange when the doctor returned, opened a
back window, helped me out into the narrow space between the
house and the overhanging bluffs, and showed me a ladder of iron
footholds mortised in the rock.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mount,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;swiftly.&nbsp; When you are at the summit, walk, so
far as you are able, in the shadow of the smoke.&nbsp; The smoke
will bring you, sooner or later, to a canyon; follow that down,
and you will find a man with two horses.&nbsp; Him you will
implicitly obey.&nbsp; And remember, silence!&nbsp; That
machinery, which I now put in motion for your service, may by one
word be turned against you.&nbsp; Go; Heaven prosper
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The ascent was easy.&nbsp; Arrived at the top of the cliff, I
saw before me on the other side a vast and gradual declivity of
stone, lying bare to the moon and the surrounding
mountains.&nbsp; Nowhere was any vantage or concealment; and
knowing how these deserts were beset with spies, I made haste to
veil my movements under the blowing trail of smoke.&nbsp;
Sometimes it swam high, rising on the night wind, and I had no
more substantial curtain than its moon-thrown shadow; sometimes
again it crawled upon the earth, and I would walk in it, no
higher than to my shoulders, like some mountain fog.&nbsp; But,
one way or another, the smoke of that ill-omened furnace
protected the first steps of my escape, and led me unobserved to
the canyon.</p>
<p>There, sure enough, I found a taciturn and sombre man beside a
pair of saddle-horses; and thenceforward, all night long, we
wandered in silence by the most occult and dangerous paths among
the mountains.&nbsp; A little before the dayspring we took refuge
in a wet and gusty cavern at the bottom of a gorge; lay there all
day concealed; and the next night, before the glow had faded out
of the west, resumed our wanderings.&nbsp; About noon we stopped
again, in a lawn upon a little river, where was a screen of
bushes; and here my guide, handing me a bundle from his pack,
bade me change my dress once more.&nbsp; The bundle contained
clothing of my own, taken from our house, with such necessaries
as a comb and soap.&nbsp; I made my toilet by the mirror of a
quiet pool; and as I was so doing, and smiling with some
complacency to see myself restored to my own image, the mountains
rang with a scream of far more than human piercingness; and while
I still stood astonished, there sprang up and swiftly increased a
storm of the most awful and earth-rending sounds.&nbsp; Shall I
own to you, that I fell upon my face and shrieked?&nbsp; And yet
this was but the overland train winding among the near mountains:
the very means of my salvation: the strong wings that were to
carry me from Utah!</p>
<p>When I was dressed, the guide gave me a bag, which contained,
he said, both money and papers; and telling me that I was already
over the borders in the territory of Wyoming, bade me follow the
stream until I reached the railway station, half a mile
below.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;is your ticket
as far as Council Bluffs.&nbsp; The East express will pass in a
few hours.&rsquo;&nbsp; With that, he took both horses, and,
without further words or any salutation, rode off by the way that
we had come.</p>
<p>Three hours afterwards, I was seated on the end platform of
the train as it swept eastward through the gorges and thundered
in tunnels of the mountain.&nbsp; The change of scene, the sense
of escape, the still throbbing terror of pursuit&mdash;above all,
the astounding magic of my new conveyance, kept me from any
logical or melancholy thought.&nbsp; I had gone to the
doctor&rsquo;s house two nights before prepared to die, prepared
for worse than death; what had passed, terrible although it was,
looked almost bright compared to my anticipations; and it was not
till I had slept a full night in the flying palace car, that I
awoke to the sense of my irreparable loss and to some reasonable
alarm about the future.&nbsp; In this mood, I examined the
contents of the bag.&nbsp; It was well supplied with gold; it
contained tickets and complete directions for my journey as far
as Liverpool, and a long letter from the doctor, supplying me
with a fictitious name and story, recommending the most guarded
silence, and bidding me to await faithfully the coming of his
son.&nbsp; All then had been arranged beforehand: he had counted
upon my consent, and what was tenfold worse, upon my
mother&rsquo;s voluntary death.&nbsp; My horror of my only
friend, my aversion for this son who was to marry me, my revolt
against the whole current and conditions of my life, were now
complete.&nbsp; I was sitting stupefied by my distress and
helplessness, when, to my joy, a very pleasant lady offered me
her conversation.&nbsp; I clutched at the relief; and I was soon
glibly telling her the story in the doctor&rsquo;s letter: how I
was a Miss Gould, of Nevada City, going to England to an uncle,
what money I had, what family, my age, and so forth, until I had
exhausted my instructions, and, as the lady still continued to
ply me with questions, began to embroider on my own
account.&nbsp; This soon carried one of my inexperience beyond
her depth; and I had already remarked a shadow on the
lady&rsquo;s face, when a gentleman drew near and very civilly
addressed me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Gould, I believe?&rsquo; said he; and then,
excusing himself to the lady by the authority of my guardian,
drew me to the fore platform of the Pullman car.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Miss Gould,&rsquo; he said in my ear, &lsquo;is it
possible that you suppose yourself in safety?&nbsp; Let me
completely undeceive you.&nbsp; One more such indiscretion and
you return to Utah.&nbsp; And, in the meanwhile, if this woman
should again address you, you are to reply with these words:
&ldquo;Madam, I do not like you, and I will be obliged if you
will suffer me to choose my own associates.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alas, I had to do as I was bid; this lady, to whom I already
felt myself drawn with the strongest cords of sympathy, I
dismissed with insult; and thenceforward, through all that day, I
sat in silence, gazing on the bare plains and swallowing my
tears.&nbsp; Let that suffice: it was the pattern of my
journey.&nbsp; Whether on the train, at the hotels, or on board
the ocean steamer, I never exchanged a friendly word with any
fellow-traveller but I was certain to be interrupted.&nbsp; In
every place, on every side, the most unlikely persons, man or
woman, rich or poor, became protectors to forward me upon my
journey, or spies to observe and regulate my conduct.&nbsp; Thus
I crossed the States, thus passed the ocean, the Mormon Eye still
following my movements; and when at length a cab had set me down
before that London lodging-house from which you saw me flee this
morning, I had already ceased to struggle and ceased to hope.</p>
<p>The landlady, like every one else through all that journey,
was expecting my arrival.&nbsp; A fire was lighted in my room,
which looked upon the garden; there were books on the table,
clothes in the drawers; and there (I had almost said with
contentment, and certainly with resignation) I saw month follow
month over my head.&nbsp; At times my landlady took me for a walk
or an excursion, but she would never suffer me to leave the house
alone; and I, seeing that she also lived under the shadow of that
widespread Mormon terror, felt too much pity to resist.&nbsp; To
the child born on Mormon soil, as to the man who accepts the
engagements of a secret order, no escape is possible; so I had
clearly read, and I was thankful even for this respite.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, I tried honestly to prepare my mind for my approaching
nuptials.&nbsp; The day drew near when my bridegroom was to visit
me, and gratitude and fear alike obliged me to consent.&nbsp; A
son of Doctor Grierson&rsquo;s, be he what he pleased, must still
be young, and it was even probable he should be handsome; on more
than that, I felt I dared not reckon; and in moulding my mind
towards consent I dwelt the more carefully on these physical
attractions which I felt I might expect, and averted my eyes from
moral or intellectual considerations.&nbsp; We have a great power
upon our spirits; and as time passed I worked myself into a frame
of acquiescence, nay, and I began to grow impatient for the
hour.&nbsp; At night sleep forsook me; I sat all day by the fire,
absorbed in dreams, conjuring up the features of my husband, and
anticipating in fancy the touch of his hand and the sound of his
voice.&nbsp; In the dead level and solitude of my existence, this
was the one eastern window and the one door of hope.&nbsp; At
last, I had so cultivated and prepared my will, that I began to
be besieged with fears upon the other side.&nbsp; How if it was I
that did not please?&nbsp; How if this unseen lover should turn
from me with disaffection?&nbsp; And now I spent hours before the
glass, studying and judging my attractions, and was never weary
of changing my dress or ordering my hair.</p>
<p>When the day came I was long about my toilet; but at last,
with a sort of hopeful desperation, I had to own that I could do
no more, and must now stand or fall by nature.&nbsp; My
occupation ended, I fell a prey to the most sickening impatience,
mingled with alarms; giving ear to the swelling rumour of the
streets, and at each change of sound or silence, starting,
shrinking, and colouring to the brow.&nbsp; Love is not to be
prepared, I know, without some knowledge of the object; and yet,
when the cab at last rattled to the door and I heard my visitor
mount the stairs, such was the tumult of hopes in my poor bosom
that love itself might have been proud to own their
parentage.&nbsp; The door opened, and it was Doctor Grierson that
appeared.&nbsp; I believe I must have screamed aloud, and I know,
at least, that I fell fainting to the floor.</p>
<p>When I came to myself he was standing over me, counting my
pulse.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have startled you,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A difficulty unforeseen&mdash;the impossibility of
obtaining a certain drug in its full purity&mdash;has forced me
to resort to London unprepared.&nbsp; I regret that I should have
shown myself once more without those poor attractions which are
much, perhaps, to you, but to me are no more considerable than
rain that falls into the sea.&nbsp; Youth is but a state, as
passing as that syncope from which you are but just awakened,
and, if there be truth in science, as easy to recall; for I find,
Asenath, that I must now take you for my confidant.&nbsp; Since
my first years, I have devoted every hour and act of life to one
ambitious task; and the time of my success is at hand.&nbsp; In
these new countries, where I was so long content to stay, I
collected indispensable ingredients; I have fortified myself on
every side from the possibility of error; what was a dream now
takes the substance of reality; and when I offered you a son of
mine I did so in a figure.&nbsp; That son&mdash;that husband,
Asenath, is myself&mdash;not as you now behold me, but restored
to the first energy of youth.&nbsp; You think me mad?&nbsp; It is
the customary attitude of ignorance.&nbsp; I will not argue; I
will leave facts to speak.&nbsp; When you behold me purified,
invigorated, renewed, restamped in the original image&mdash;when
you recognise in me (what I shall be) the first perfect
expression of the powers of mankind&mdash;I shall be able to
laugh with a better grace at your passing and natural
incredulity.&nbsp; To what can you aspire&mdash;fame, riches,
power, the charm of youth, the dear-bought wisdom of
age&mdash;that I shall not be able to afford you in
perfection?&nbsp; Do not deceive yourself.&nbsp; I already excel
you in every human gift but one: when that gift also has been
restored to me you will recognise your master.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hereupon, consulting his watch, he told me he must now leave
me to myself; and bidding me consult reason, and not girlish
fancies, he withdrew.&nbsp; I had not the courage to move; the
night fell and found me still where he had laid me during my
faint, my face buried in my hands, my soul drowned in the darkest
apprehensions.&nbsp; Late in the evening he returned, carrying a
candle, and, with a certain irritable tremor, bade me rise and
sup.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is it possible,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;that I
have been deceived in your courage?&nbsp; A cowardly girl is no
fit mate for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I flung myself before him on my knees, and with floods of
tears besought him to release me from this engagement, assuring
him that my cowardice was abject, and that in every point of
intellect and character I was his hopeless and derisible
inferior.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, certainly,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know
you better than yourself; and I am well enough acquainted with
human nature to understand this scene.&nbsp; It is addressed to
me,&rsquo; he added with a smile, &lsquo;in my character of the
still untransformed.&nbsp; But do not alarm yourself about the
future.&nbsp; Let me but attain my end, and not you only,
Asenath, but every woman on the face of the earth becomes my
willing slave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he obliged me to rise and eat; sat down with me to
table; helped and entertained me with the attentions of a
fashionable host; and it was not till a late hour, that, bidding
me courteously good-night, he once more left me alone to my
misery.</p>
<p>In all this talk of an elixir and the restoration of his
youth, I scarce knew from which hypothesis I should the more
eagerly recoil.&nbsp; If his hopes reposed on any base of fact,
if indeed, by some abhorrent miracle, he should discard his age,
death were my only refuge from that most unnatural, that most
ungodly union.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, these dreams were
merely lunatic, the madness of a life waxed suddenly acute, my
pity would become a load almost as heavy to bear as my revolt
against the marriage.&nbsp; So passed the night, in alternations
of rebellion and despair, of hate and pity; and with the next
morning I was only to comprehend more fully my enslaved
position.&nbsp; For though he appeared with a very tranquil
countenance, he had no sooner observed the marks of grief upon my
brow than an answering darkness gathered on his own.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Asenath.&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you owe me much already;
with one finger I still hold you suspended over death; my life is
full of labour and anxiety; and I choose,&rsquo; said he, with a
remarkable accent of command, &lsquo;that you shall greet me with
a pleasant face.&rsquo;&nbsp; He never needed to repeat the
recommendation; from that day forward I was always ready to
receive him with apparent cheerfulness; and he rewarded me with a
good deal of his company, and almost more than I could bear of
his confidence.&nbsp; He had set up a laboratory in the back part
of the house, where he toiled day and night at his elixir, and he
would come thence to visit me in my parlour: now with passing
humours of discouragement; now, and far more often, radiant with
hope.&nbsp; It was impossible to see so much of him, and not to
recognise that the sands of his life were running low; and yet
all the time he would be laying out vast fields of future, and
planning, with all the confidence of youth, the most unbounded
schemes of pleasure and ambition.&nbsp; How I replied I know not;
but I found a voice and words to answer, even while I wept and
raged to hear him.</p>
<p>A week ago the doctor entered my room with the marks of great
exhilaration contending with pitiful bodily weakness.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Asenath,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I have now obtained the
last ingredient.&nbsp; In one week from now the perilous moment
of the last projection will draw nigh.&nbsp; You have once before
assisted, although unconsciously, at the failure of a similar
experiment.&nbsp; It was the elixir which so terribly exploded
one night when you were passing my house; and it is idle to deny
that the conduct of so delicate a process, among the million jars
and trepidations of so great a city, presents a certain element
of danger.&nbsp; From this point of view, I cannot but regret the
perfect stillness of my house among the deserts; but, on the
other hand, I have succeeded in proving that the singularly
unstable equilibrium of the elixir, at the moment of projection,
is due rather to the impurity than to the nature of the
ingredients; and as all are now of an equal and exquisite nicety,
I have little fear for the result.&nbsp; In a week then from
to-day, my dear Asenath, this period of trial will be
ended.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he smiled upon me in a manner unusually
paternal.</p>
<p>I smiled back with my lips, but at my heart there raged the
blackest and most unbridled terror.&nbsp; What if he
failed?&nbsp; And oh, tenfold worse! what if he succeeded?&nbsp;
What detested and unnatural changeling would appear before me to
claim my hand?&nbsp; And could there, I asked myself with a
dreadful sinking, be any truth in his boasts of an assured
victory over my reluctance?&nbsp; I knew him, indeed, to be
masterful, to lead my life at a sign.&nbsp; Suppose, then, this
experiment to succeed; suppose him to return to me, hideously
restored, like a vampire in a legend; and suppose that, by some
devilish fascination . . . My head turned; all former fears
deserted me: and I felt I could embrace the worst in preference
to this.</p>
<p>My mind was instantly made up.&nbsp; The doctor&rsquo;s
presence in London was justified by the affairs of the Mormon
polity.&nbsp; Often, in our conversation, he would gloat over the
details of that great organisation, which he feared even while
yet he wielded it; and would remind me, that even in the humming
labyrinth of London, we were still visible to that unsleeping eye
in Utah.&nbsp; His visitors, indeed, who were of every sort, from
the missionary to the destroying angel, and seemed to belong to
every rank of life, had, up to that moment, filled me with
unmixed repulsion and alarm.&nbsp; I knew that if my secret were
to reach the ear of any leader my fate were sealed beyond
redemption; and yet in my present pass of horror and despair, it
was to these very men that I turned for help.&nbsp; I waylaid
upon the stair one of the Mormon missionaries, a man of a low
class, but not inaccessible to pity; told him I scarce remember
what elaborate fable to explain my application; and by his
intermediacy entered into correspondence with my father&rsquo;s
family.&nbsp; They recognised my claim for help, and on this very
day I was to begin my escape.</p>
<p>Last night I sat up fully dressed, awaiting the result of the
doctor&rsquo;s labours, and prepared against the worst.&nbsp; The
nights at this season and in this northern latitude are short;
and I had soon the company of the returning daylight.&nbsp; The
silence in and around the house was only broken by the movements
of the doctor in the laboratory; to these I listened, watch in
hand, awaiting the hour of my escape, and yet consumed by anxiety
about the strange experiment that was going forward
overhead.&nbsp; Indeed, now that I was conscious of some
protection for myself, my sympathies had turned more directly to
the doctor&rsquo;s side; I caught myself even praying for his
success; and when some hours ago a low, peculiar cry reached my
ears from the laboratory, I could no longer control my
impatience, but mounted the stairs and opened the door.</p>
<p>The doctor was standing in the middle of the room; in his hand
a large, round-bellied, crystal flask, some three parts full of a
bright amber-coloured liquid; on his face a rapture of gratitude
and joy unspeakable.&nbsp; As he saw me he raised the flask at
arm&rsquo;s length.&nbsp; &lsquo;Victory!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Victory, Asenath!&rsquo;&nbsp; And then&mdash;whether the
flask escaped his trembling fingers, or whether the explosion
were spontaneous, I cannot tell&mdash;enough that we were thrown,
I against the door-post, the doctor into the corner of the room;
enough that we were shaken to the soul by the same explosion that
must have startled you upon the street; and that, in the brief
space of an indistinguishable instant, there remained nothing of
the labours of the doctor&rsquo;s lifetime but a few shards of
broken crystal and those voluminous and ill-smelling vapours that
pursued me in my flight.</p>

76</span><i>THE SQUIRE OF DAMES</i><br />
(<i>Concluded</i>)</h2>
<p>What with the lady&rsquo;s animated manner and dramatic
conduct of her voice, Challoner had thrilled to every incident
with genuine emotion.&nbsp; His fancy, which was not perhaps of a
very lively character, applauded both the matter and the style;
but the more judicial functions of his mind refused assent.&nbsp;
It was an excellent story; and it might be true, but he believed
it was not.&nbsp; Miss Fonblanque was a lady, and it was
doubtless possible for a lady to wander from the truth; but how
was a gentleman to tell her so?&nbsp; His spirits for some time
had been sinking, but they now fell to zero; and long after her
voice had died away he still sat with a troubled and averted
countenance, and could find no form of words to thank her for her
narrative.&nbsp; His mind, indeed, was empty of everything beyond
a dull longing for escape.&nbsp; From this pause, which grew the
more embarrassing with every second, he was roused by the sudden
laughter of the lady.&nbsp; His vanity was alarmed; he turned and
faced her; their eyes met; and he caught from hers a spark of
such frank merriment as put him instantly at ease.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You certainly,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;appear to bear
your calamities with excellent spirit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do I not?&rsquo; she cried, and fell once more into
delicious laughter.&nbsp; But from this access she more speedily
recovered.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is all very well,&rsquo; said she,
nodding at him gravely, &lsquo;but I am still in a most
distressing situation, from which, if you deny me your help, I
shall find it difficult indeed to free myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this mention of help Challoner fell back to his original
gloom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My sympathies are much engaged with you,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;and I should be delighted, I am sure.&nbsp; But our
position is most unusual; and circumstances over which I have, I
can assure you, no control, deprive me of the power&mdash;the
pleasure&mdash;Unless, indeed,&rsquo; he added, somewhat
brightening at the thought, &lsquo;I were to recommend you to the
care of the police?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She laid her hand upon his arm and looked hard into his eyes;
and he saw with wonder that, for the first time since the moment
of their meeting, every trace of colour had faded from her
cheek.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do so,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and&mdash;weigh my words
well&mdash;you kill me as certainly as with a knife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God bless me!&rsquo; exclaimed Challoner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;I can see you disbelieve
my story and make light of the perils that surround me; but who
are you to judge?&nbsp; My family share my apprehensions; they
help me in secret; and you saw yourself by what an emissary, and
in what a place, they have chosen to supply me with the funds for
my escape.&nbsp; I admit that you are brave and clever and have
impressed me most favourably; but how are you to prefer your
opinion before that of my uncle, an ex-minister of state, a man
with the ear of the Queen, and of a long political
experience?&nbsp; If I am mad, is he?&nbsp; And you must allow
me, besides, a special claim upon your help.&nbsp; Strange as you
may think my story, you know that much of it is true; and if you
who heard the explosion and saw the Mormon at Victoria, refuse to
credit and assist me, to whom am I to turn?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He gave you money then?&rsquo; asked Challoner, who had
been dwelling singly on that fact.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I begin to interest you,&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But, frankly, you are condemned to help me.&nbsp; If the
service I had to ask of you were serious, were suspicious, were
even unusual, I should say no more.&nbsp; But what is it?&nbsp;
To take a pleasure trip (for which, if you will suffer me, I
propose to pay) and to carry from one lady to another a sum of
money!&nbsp; What can be more simple?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is the sum,&rsquo; asked Challoner,
&lsquo;considerable?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She produced a packet from her bosom; and observing that she
had not yet found time to make the count, tore open the cover and
spread upon her knees a considerable number of Bank of England
notes.&nbsp; It took some time to make the reckoning, for the
notes were of every degree of value; but at last, and counting a
few loose sovereigns, she made out the sum to be a little under
&pound;710 sterling.&nbsp; The sight of so much money worked an
immediate revolution in the mind of Challoner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you propose, madam,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;to
intrust that money to a perfect stranger?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said she, with a charming smile, &lsquo;but
I no longer regard you as a stranger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; said Challoner, &lsquo;I perceive I must
make you a confession.&nbsp; Although of a very good
family&mdash;through my mother, indeed, a lineal descendant of
the patriot Bruce&mdash;I dare not conceal from you that my
affairs are deeply, very deeply involved.&nbsp; I am in debt; my
pockets are practically empty; and, in short, I am fallen to that
state when a considerable sum of money would prove to many men an
irresistible temptation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you not see,&rsquo; returned the young lady,
&lsquo;that by these words you have removed my last
hesitation?&nbsp; Take them.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she thrust the
notes into the young man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>He sat so long, holding them, like a baby at the font, that
Miss Fonblanque once more bubbled into laughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;hesitate no further; put
them in your pocket; and to relieve our position of any shadow of
embarrassment, tell me by what name I am to address my
knight-errant, for I find myself reduced to the awkwardness of
the pronoun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Had borrowing been in question, the wisdom of our ancestors
had come lightly to the young man&rsquo;s aid; but upon what
pretext could he refuse so generous a trust?&nbsp; Upon none he
saw, that was not unpardonably wounding; and the bright eyes and
the high spirits of his companion had already made a breach in
the rampart of Challoner&rsquo;s caution.&nbsp; The whole thing,
he reasoned, might be a mere mystification, which it were the
height of solemn folly to resent.&nbsp; On the other hand, the
explosion, the interview at the public-house, and the very money
in his hands, seemed to prove beyond denial the existence of some
serious danger; and if that were so, could he desert her?&nbsp;
There was a choice of risks: the risk of behaving with
extraordinary incivility and unhandsomeness to a lady, and the
risk of going on a fool&rsquo;s errand.&nbsp; The story seemed
false; but then the money was undeniable.&nbsp; The whole
circumstances were questionable and obscure; but the lady was
charming, and had the speech and manners of society.&nbsp; While
he still hung in the wind, a recollection returned upon his mind
with some of the dignity of prophecy.&nbsp; Had he not promised
Somerset to break with the traditions of the commonplace, and to
accept the first adventure offered?&nbsp; Well, here was the
adventure.</p>
<p>He thrust the money into his pocket.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My name is Challoner,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Challoner,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;you have come
very generously to my aid when all was against me.&nbsp; Though I
am myself a very humble person, my family commands great
interest; and I do not think you will repent this handsome
action.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Challoner flushed with pleasure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I imagine that, perhaps, a consulship,&rsquo; she
added, her eyes dwelling on him with a judicial admiration,
&lsquo;a consulship in some great town or capital&mdash;or
else&mdash;But we waste time; let us set about the work of my
delivery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She took his arm with a frank confidence that went to his
heart; and once more laying by all serious thoughts, she
entertained him, as they crossed the park, with her agreeable
gaiety of mind.&nbsp; Near the Marble Arch they found a hansom,
which rapidly conveyed them to the terminus at Euston Square; and
here, in the hotel, they sat down to an excellent
breakfast.&nbsp; The young lady&rsquo;s first step was to call
for writing materials and write, upon one corner of the table, a
hasty note; still, as she did so, glancing with smiles at her
companion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;here is the
letter which will introduce you to my cousin.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
began to fold the paper.&nbsp; &lsquo;My cousin, although I have
never seen her, has the character of a very charming woman and a
recognised beauty; of that I know nothing, but at least she has
been very kind to me; so has my lord her father; so have
you&mdash;kinder than all&mdash;kinder than I can bear to think
of.&rsquo;&nbsp; She said this with unusual emotion; and, at the
same time, sealed the envelope.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; she
cried, &lsquo;I have shut my letter!&nbsp; It is not quite
courteous; and yet, as between friends, it is perhaps better
so.&nbsp; I introduce you, after all, into a family secret; and
though you and I are already old comrades, you are still unknown
to my uncle.&nbsp; You go then to this address, Richard Street,
Glasgow; go, please, as soon as you arrive; and give this letter
with your own hands into those of Miss Fonblanque, for that is
the name by which she is to pass.&nbsp; When we next meet, you
will tell me what you think of her,&rsquo; she added, with a
touch of the provocative.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Challoner, almost tenderly, &lsquo;she
can be nothing to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not know,&rsquo; replied the young lady, with a
sigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;By-the-bye, I had forgotten&mdash;it is very
childish, and I am almost ashamed to mention it&mdash;but when
you see Miss Fonblanque, you will have to make yourself a little
ridiculous; and I am sure the part in no way suits you.&nbsp; We
had agreed upon a watchword.&nbsp; You will have to address an
earl&rsquo;s daughter in these words: &ldquo;<i>Nigger</i>,
<i>nigger</i>, <i>never die</i>;&rdquo; but reassure
yourself,&rsquo; she added, laughing, &lsquo;for the fair
patrician will at once finish the quotation.&nbsp; Come now, say
your lesson.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Nigger, nigger, never die,&rdquo;&rsquo;
repeated Challoner, with undisguised reluctance.</p>
<p>Miss Fonblanque went into fits of laughter.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Excellent,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;it will be the most
humorous scene.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she laughed again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what will be the counterword?&rsquo; asked
Challoner stiffly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not tell you till the last moment,&rsquo; said
she; &lsquo;for I perceive you are growing too
imperious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Breakfast over, she accompanied the young man to the platform,
bought him the <i>Graphic</i>, the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, and a
paper-cutter, and stood on the step conversing till the whistle
sounded.&nbsp; Then she put her head into the carriage.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>Black face and shining eye</i>!&rsquo; she whispered,
and instantly leaped down upon the platform, with a thrill of gay
and musical laughter.&nbsp; As the train steamed out of the great
arch of glass, the sound of that laughter still rang in the young
man&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>Challoner&rsquo;s position was too unusual to be long welcome
to his mind.&nbsp; He found himself projected the whole length of
England, on a mission beset with obscure and ridiculous
circumstances, and yet, by the trust he had accepted, irrevocably
bound to persevere.&nbsp; How easy it appeared, in the
retrospect, to have refused the whole proposal, returned the
money, and gone forth again upon his own affairs, a free and
happy man!&nbsp; And it was now impossible: the enchantress who
had held him with her eye had now disappeared, taking his honour
in pledge; and as she had failed to leave him an address, he was
denied even the inglorious safety of retreat.&nbsp; To use the
paper-knife, or even to read the periodicals with which she had
presented him, was to renew the bitterness of his remorse; and as
he was alone in the compartment, he passed the day staring at the
landscape in impotent repentance, and long before he was landed
on the platform of St. Enoch&rsquo;s, had fallen to the lowest
and coldest zones of self-contempt.</p>
<p>As he was hungry, and elegant in his habits, he would have
preferred to dine and to remove the stains of travel; but the
words of the young lady, and his own impatient eagerness, would
suffer no delay.&nbsp; In the late, luminous, and lamp-starred
dusk of the summer evening, he accordingly set forward with brisk
steps.</p>
<p>The street to which he was directed had first seen the day in
the character of a row of small suburban villas on a hillside;
but the extension of the city had long since, and on every hand,
surrounded it with miles of streets.&nbsp; From the top of the
hill a range of very tall buildings, densely inhabited by the
poorest classes of the population and variegated by drying-poles
from every second window, overplumbed the villas and their little
gardens like a sea-board cliff.&nbsp; But still, under the grime
of years of city smoke, these antiquated cottages, with their
venetian blinds and rural porticoes, retained a somewhat
melancholy savour of the past.</p>
<p>The street when Challoner entered it was perfectly
deserted.&nbsp; From hard by, indeed, the sound of a thousand
footfalls filled the ear; but in Richard Street itself there was
neither light nor sound of human habitation.&nbsp; The appearance
of the neighbourhood weighed heavily on the mind of the young
man; once more, as in the streets of London, he was impressed
with the sense of city deserts; and as he approached the number
indicated, and somewhat falteringly rang the bell, his heart sank
within him.</p>
<p>The bell was ancient, like the house; it had a thin and
garrulous note; and it was some time before it ceased to sound
from the rear quarters of the building.&nbsp; Following upon this
an inner door was stealthily opened, and careful and catlike
steps drew near along the hall.&nbsp; Challoner, supposing he was
to be instantly admitted, produced his letter, and, as well as he
was able, prepared a smiling face.&nbsp; To his indescribable
surprise, however, the footsteps ceased, and then, after a pause
and with the like stealthiness, withdrew once more, and died away
in the interior of the house.&nbsp; A second time the young man
rang violently at the bell; a second time, to his keen
hearkening, a certain bustle of discreet footing moved upon the
hollow boards of the old villa; and again the fainthearted
garrison only drew near to retreat.&nbsp; The cup of the
visitor&rsquo;s endurance was now full to overflowing; and,
committing the whole family of Fonblanque to every mood and shade
of condemnation, he turned upon his heel and redescended the
steps.&nbsp; Perhaps the mover in the house was watching from a
window, and plucked up courage at the sight of this desistance;
or perhaps, where he lurked trembling in the back parts of the
villa, reason in its own right had conquered his alarms.&nbsp;
Challoner, at least, had scarce set foot upon the pavement when
he was arrested by the sound of the withdrawal of an inner bolt;
one followed another, rattling in their sockets; the key turned
harshly in the lock; the door opened; and there appeared upon the
threshold a man of a very stalwart figure in his shirt
sleeves.&nbsp; He was a person neither of great manly beauty nor
of a refined exterior; he was not the man, in ordinary moods, to
attract the eyes of the observer; but as he now stood in the
doorway, he was marked so legibly with the extreme passion of
terror that Challoner stood wonder-struck.&nbsp; For a fraction
of a minute they gazed upon each other in silence; and then the
man of the house, with ashen lips and gasping voice, inquired the
business of his visitor.&nbsp; Challoner replied, in tones from
which he strove to banish his surprise, that he was the bearer of
a letter to a certain Miss Fonblanque.&nbsp; At this name, as at
a talisman, the man fell back and impatiently invited him to
enter; and no sooner had the adventurer crossed the threshold,
than the door was closed behind him and his retreat cut off.</p>
<p>It was already long past eight at night; and though the late
twilight of the north still lingered in the streets, in the
passage it was already groping dark.&nbsp; The man led Challoner
directly to a parlour looking on the garden to the back.&nbsp;
Here he had apparently been supping; for by the light of a tallow
dip the table was seen to be covered with a napkin, and set out
with a quart of bottled ale and the heel of a Gouda cheese.&nbsp;
The room, on the other hand, was furnished with faded solidity,
and the walls were lined with scholarly and costly volumes in
glazed cases.&nbsp; The house must have been taken furnished; for
it had no congruity with this man of the shirt sleeves and the
mean supper.&nbsp; As for the earl&rsquo;s daughter, the earl and
the visionary consulships in foreign cities, they had long ago
begun to fade in Challoner&rsquo;s imagination.&nbsp; Like Doctor
Grierson and the Mormon angels, they were plainly woven of the
stuff of dreams.&nbsp; Not an illusion remained to the
knight-errant; not a hope was left him, but to be speedily
relieved from this disreputable business.</p>
<p>The man had continued to regard his visitor with undisguised
anxiety, and began once more to press him for his errand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am here,&rsquo; said Challoner, &lsquo;simply to do a
service between two ladies; and I must ask you, without further
delay, to summon Miss Fonblanque, into whose hands alone I am
authorised to deliver the letter that I bear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A growing wonder began to mingle on the man&rsquo;s face with
the lines of solicitude.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am Miss
Fonblanque,&rsquo; he said; and then, perceiving the effect of
this communication, &lsquo;Good God!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;what
are you staring at?&nbsp; I tell you, I am Miss
Fonblanque.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Seeing the speaker wore a chin-beard of considerable length,
and the remainder of his face was blue with shaving, Challoner
could only suppose himself the subject of a jest.&nbsp; He was no
longer under the spell of the young lady&rsquo;s presence; and
with men, and above all with his inferiors, he was capable of
some display of spirit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said he, pretty roundly, &lsquo;I have put
myself to great inconvenience for persons of whom I know too
little, and I begin to be weary of the business.&nbsp; Either you
shall immediately summon Miss Fonblanque, or I leave this house
and put myself under the direction of the police.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is horrible!&rsquo; exclaimed the man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I declare before Heaven I am the person meant, but how
shall I convince you?&nbsp; It must have been Clara, I perceive,
that sent you on this errand&mdash;a madwoman, who jests with the
most deadly interests; and here we are incapable, perhaps, of an
agreement, and Heaven knows what may depend on our
delay!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with a really startling earnestness; and at the same
time there flashed upon the mind of Challoner the ridiculous
jingle which was to serve as password.&nbsp; &lsquo;This may,
perhaps, assist you,&rsquo; he said, and then, with some
embarrassment, &lsquo;&ldquo;Nigger, nigger, never
die.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>A light of relief broke upon the troubled countenance of the
man with the chin-beard.&nbsp; &lsquo;&ldquo;Black face and
shining eye&rdquo;&mdash;give me the letter,&rsquo; he panted, in
one gasp.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Challoner, though still with some
reluctance, &lsquo;I suppose I must regard you as the proper
recipient; and though I may justly complain of the spirit in
which I have been treated, I am only too glad to be done with all
responsibility.&nbsp; Here it is,&rsquo; and he produced the
envelope.</p>
<p>The man leaped upon it like a beast, and with hands that
trembled in a manner painful to behold, tore it open and unfolded
the letter.&nbsp; As he read, terror seemed to mount upon him to
the pitch of nightmare.&nbsp; He struck one hand upon his brow,
while with the other, as if unconsciously, he crumpled the paper
to a ball.&nbsp; &lsquo;My gracious powers!&rsquo; he cried; and
then, dashing to the window, which stood open on the garden, he
clapped forth his head and shoulders, and whistled long and
shrill.&nbsp; Challoner fell back into a corner, and resolutely
grasping his staff, prepared for the most desperate events; but
the thoughts of the man with the chin-beard were far removed from
violence.&nbsp; Turning again into the room, and once more
beholding his visitor, whom he appeared to have forgotten, he
fairly danced with trepidation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo;
he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, quite impossible!&nbsp; O Lord, I have
lost my head.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, once more striking his hand
upon his brow, &lsquo;The money!&rsquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Give me the money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My good friend,&rsquo; replied Challoner, &lsquo;this
is a very painful exhibition; and until I see you reasonably
master of yourself, I decline to proceed with any
business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are quite right,&rsquo; said the man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am of a very nervous habit; a long course of the dumb
ague has undermined my constitution.&nbsp; But I know you have
money; it may be still the saving of me; and oh, dear young
gentleman, in pity&rsquo;s name be expeditious!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Challoner, sincerely uneasy as he was, could scarce refrain from
laughter; but he was himself in a hurry to be gone, and without
more delay produced the money.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will find the
sum, I trust, correct,&rsquo; he observed &lsquo;and let me ask
you to give me a receipt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the man heeded him not.&nbsp; He seized the money, and
disregarding the sovereigns that rolled loose upon the floor,
thrust the bundle of notes into his pocket.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A receipt,&rsquo; repeated Challoner, with some
asperity.&nbsp; &lsquo;I insist on a receipt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Receipt?&rsquo; repeated the man, a little
wildly.&nbsp; &lsquo;A receipt?&nbsp; Immediately!&nbsp; Await me
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Challoner, in reply, begged the gentleman to lose no
unnecessary time, as he was himself desirous of catching a
particular train.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, by God, and so am I!&rsquo; exclaimed the man with
the chin-beard; and with that he was gone out of the room, and
had rattled upstairs, four at a time, to the upper story of the
villa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is certainly a most amazing business,&rsquo;
thought Challoner; &lsquo;certainly a most disquieting affair;
and I cannot conceal from myself that I have become mixed up with
either lunatics or malefactors.&nbsp; I may truly thank my stars
that I am so nearly and so creditably done with it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Thus thinking, and perhaps remembering the episode of the
whistle, he turned to the open window.&nbsp; The garden was still
faintly clear; he could distinguish the stairs and terraces with
which the small domain had been adorned by former owners, and the
blackened bushes and dead trees that had once afforded shelter to
the country birds; beyond these he saw the strong retaining wall,
some thirty feet in height, which enclosed the garden to the
back; and again above that, the pile of dingy buildings rearing
its frontage high into the night.&nbsp; A peculiar object lying
stretched upon the lawn for some time baffled his eyesight; but
at length he had made it out to be a long ladder, or series of
ladders bound into one; and he was still wondering of what
service so great an instrument could be in such a scant
enclosure, when he was recalled to himself by the noise of some
one running violently down the stairs.&nbsp; This was followed by
the sudden, clamorous banging of the house door; and that again,
by rapid and retreating footsteps in the street.</p>
<p>Challoner sprang into the passage.&nbsp; He ran from room to
room, upstairs and downstairs; and in that old dingy and
worm-eaten house, he found himself alone.&nbsp; Only in one
apartment, looking to the front, were there any traces of the
late inhabitant: a bed that had been recently slept in and not
made, a chest of drawers disordered by a hasty search, and on the
floor a roll of crumpled paper.&nbsp; This he picked up.&nbsp;
The light in this upper story looking to the front was
considerably brighter than in the parlour; and he was able to
make out that the paper bore the mark of the hotel at Euston, and
even, by peering closely, to decipher the following lines in a
very elegant and careful female hand:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear
M&lsquo;Guire</span>,&mdash;It is certain your retreat is
known.&nbsp; We have just had another failure, clockwork thirty
hours too soon, with the usual humiliating result.&nbsp; Zero is
quite disheartened.&nbsp; We are all scattered, and I could find
no one but the <i>solemn ass</i> who brings you this and the
money.&nbsp; I would love to see your meeting.&mdash;Ever
yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Shining
Eye</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Challoner was stricken to the heart.&nbsp; He perceived by
what facility, by what unmanly fear of ridicule, he had been
brought down to be the gull of this intriguer; and his wrath
flowed forth in almost equal measure against himself, against the
woman, and against Somerset, whose idle counsels had impelled him
to embark on that adventure.&nbsp; At the same time a great and
troubled curiosity, and a certain chill of fear, possessed his
spirit.&nbsp; The conduct of the man with the chin-beard, the
terms of the letter, and the explosion of the early morning,
fitted together like parts in some obscure and mischievous
imbroglio.&nbsp; Evil was certainly afoot; evil, secrecy, terror,
and falsehood were the conditions and the passions of the people
among whom he had begun to move, like a blind puppet; and he who
began as a puppet, his experience told him, was often doomed to
perish as a victim.</p>
<p>From the stupor of deep thought into which he had glided with
the letter in his hand, he was awakened by the clatter of the
bell.&nbsp; He glanced from the window; and, conceive his horror
and surprise when he beheld, clustered on the steps, in the front
garden and on the pavement of the street, a formidable posse of
police!&nbsp; He started to the full possession of his powers and
courage.&nbsp; Escape, and escape at any cost, was the one idea
that possessed him.&nbsp; Swiftly and silently he redescended the
creaking stairs; he was already in the passage when a second and
more imperious summons from the door awoke the echoes of the
empty house; nor had the bell ceased to jangle before he had
bestridden the window-sill of the parlour and was lowering
himself into the garden.&nbsp; His coat was hooked upon the iron
flower-basket; for a moment he hung dependent heels and head
below; and then, with the noise of rending cloth, and followed by
several pots, he dropped upon the sod.&nbsp; Once more the bell
was rung, and now with furious and repeated peals.&nbsp; The
desperate Challoner turned his eyes on every side.&nbsp; They
fell upon the ladder, and he ran to it, and with strenuous but
unavailing effort sought to raise it from the ground.&nbsp;
Suddenly the weight, which was thus resisting his whole strength,
began to lighten in his hands; the ladder, like a thing of life,
reared its bulk from off the sod; and Challoner, leaping back
with a cry of almost superstitious terror, beheld the whole
structure mount, foot by foot, against the face of the retaining
wall.&nbsp; At the same time, two heads were dimly visible above
the parapet, and he was hailed by a guarded whistle.&nbsp;
Something in its modulation recalled, like an echo, the whistle
of the man with the chin-beard.</p>
<p>Had he chanced upon a means of escape prepared beforehand by
those very miscreants whose messenger and gull he had
become?&nbsp; Was this, indeed, a means of safety, or but the
starting-point of further complication and disaster?&nbsp; He
paused not to reflect.&nbsp; Scarce was the ladder reared to its
full length than he had sprung already on the rounds; hand over
hand, swift as an ape, he scaled the tottering stairway.&nbsp;
Strong arms received, embraced, and helped him; he was lifted and
set once more upon the earth; and with the spasm of his alarm yet
unsubsided, found himself in the company of two rough-looking
men, in the paved back yard of one of the tall houses that
crowned the summit of the hill.&nbsp; Meanwhile, from below, the
note of the bell had been succeeded by the sound of vigorous and
redoubling blows.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you all out?&rsquo; asked one of his companions;
and, as soon as he had babbled an answer in the affirmative, the
rope was cut from the top round, and the ladder thrust roughly
back into the garden, where it fell and broke with clattering
reverberations.&nbsp; Its fall was hailed with many broken cries;
for the whole of Richard Street was now in high emotion, the
people crowding to the windows or clambering on the garden
walls.&nbsp; The same man who had already addressed Challoner
seized him by the arm; whisked him through the basement of the
house and across the street upon the other side; and before the
unfortunate adventurer had time to realise his situation, a door
was opened, and he was thrust into a low and dark
compartment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bedad,&rsquo; observed his guide, &lsquo;there was no
time to lose.&nbsp; Is M&rsquo;Guire gone, or was it you that
whistled?</p>
<p>&lsquo;M&rsquo;Guire is gone,&rsquo; said Challoner.</p>
<p>The guide now struck a light.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;this will never do.&nbsp; You dare not go upon the streets
in such a figure.&nbsp; Wait quietly here and I will bring you
something decent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that the man was gone, and Challoner, his attention thus
rudely awakened, began ruefully to consider the havoc that had
been worked in his attire.&nbsp; His hat was gone; his trousers
were cruelly ripped; and the best part of one tail of his very
elegant frockcoat had been left hanging from the iron crockets of
the window.&nbsp; He had scarce had time to measure these
disasters when his host re-entered the apartment and proceeded,
without a word, to envelop the refined and urbane Challoner in a
long ulster of the cheapest material, and of a pattern so gross
and vulgar that his spirit sickened at the sight.&nbsp; This
calumnious disguise was crowned and completed by a soft felt hat
of the Tyrolese design, and several sizes too small.&nbsp; At
another moment Challoner would simply have refused to issue forth
upon the world thus travestied; but the desire to escape from
Glasgow was now too strongly and too exclusively impressed upon
his mind.&nbsp; With one haggard glance at the spotted tails of
his new coat, he inquired what was to pay for this
accoutrement.&nbsp; The man assured him that the whole expense
was easily met from funds in his possession, and begged him,
instead of wasting time, to make his best speed out of the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The young man was not loath to take the hint.&nbsp; True to
his usual courtesy, he thanked the speaker and complimented him
upon his taste in greatcoats; and leaving the man somewhat
abashed by these remarks and the manner of their delivery, he
hurried forth into the lamplit city.&nbsp; The last train was
gone ere, after many deviations, he had reached the
terminus.&nbsp; Attired as he was he dared not present himself at
any reputable inn; and he felt keenly that the unassuming dignity
of his demeanour would serve to attract attention, perhaps mirth
and possibly suspicion, in any humbler hostelry.&nbsp; He was
thus condemned to pass the solemn and uneventful hours of a whole
night in pacing the streets of Glasgow; supperless; a figure of
fun for all beholders; waiting the dawn, with hope indeed, but
with unconquerable shrinkings; and above all things, filled with
a profound sense of the folly and weakness of his conduct.&nbsp;
It may be conceived with what curses he assailed the memory of
the fair narrator of Hyde Park; her parting laughter rang in his
ears all night with damning mockery and iteration; and when he
could spare a thought from this chief artificer of his confusion,
it was to expend his wrath on Somerset and the career of the
amateur detective.&nbsp; With the coming of day, he found in a
shy milk-shop the means to appease his hunger.&nbsp; There were
still many hours to wait before the departure of the South
express; these he passed wandering with indescribable fatigue in
the obscurer by-streets of the city; and at length slipped
quietly into the station and took his place in the darkest corner
of a third-class carriage.&nbsp; Here, all day long, he jolted on
the bare boards, distressed by heat and continually reawakened
from uneasy slumbers.&nbsp; By the half return ticket in his
purse, he was entitled to make the journey on the easy cushions
and with the ample space of the first-class; but alas! in his
absurd attire, he durst not, for decency, commingle with his
equals; and this small annoyance, coming last in such a series of
disasters, cut him to the heart.</p>
<p>That night, when, in his Putney lodging, he reviewed the
expense, anxiety, and weariness of his adventure; when he beheld
the ruins of his last good trousers and his last presentable
coat; and above all, when his eye by any chance alighted on the
Tyrolese hat or the degrading ulster, his heart would overflow
with bitterness, and it was only by a serious call on his
philosophy that he maintained the dignity of his demeanour.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 100</span>SOMERSET&rsquo;S ADVENTURE</h2>
<h3><i>THE SUPERFLUOUS MANSION</i></h3>
<p>Mr. Paul Somerset was a young gentleman of a lively and fiery
imagination, with very small capacity for action.&nbsp; He was
one who lived exclusively in dreams and in the future: the
creature of his own theories, and an actor in his own
romances.&nbsp; From the cigar divan he proceeded to parade the
streets, still heated with the fire of his eloquence, and
scouting upon every side for the offer of some fortunate
adventure.&nbsp; In the continual stream of passers-by, on the
sealed fronts of houses, on the posters that covered the
hoardings, and in every lineament and throb of the great city, he
saw a mysterious and hopeful hieroglyph.&nbsp; But although the
elements of adventure were streaming by him as thick as drops of
water in the Thames, it was in vain that, now with a beseeching,
now with something of a braggadocio air, he courted and provoked
the notice of the passengers; in vain that, putting fortune to
the touch, he even thrust himself into the way and came into
direct collision with those of the more promising
demeanour.&nbsp; Persons brimful of secrets, persons pining for
affection, persons perishing for lack of help or counsel, he was
sure he could perceive on every side; but by some contrariety of
fortune, each passed upon his way without remarking the young
gentleman, and went farther (surely to fare worse!) in quest of
the confidant, the friend, or the adviser.&nbsp; To thousands he
must have turned an appealing countenance, and yet not one
regarded him.</p>
<p>A light dinner, eaten to the accompaniment of his impetuous
aspirations, broke in upon the series of his attempts on fortune;
and when he returned to the task, the lamps were already lighted,
and the nocturnal crowd was dense upon the pavement.&nbsp; Before
a certain restaurant, whose name will readily occur to any
student of our Babylon, people were already packed so closely
that passage had grown difficult; and Somerset, standing in the
kennel, watched, with a hope that was beginning to grow somewhat
weary, the faces and the manners of the crowd.&nbsp; Suddenly he
was startled by a gentle touch upon the shoulder, and facing
about, he was aware of a very plain and elegant brougham, drawn
by a pair of powerful horses, and driven by a man in sober
livery.&nbsp; There were no arms upon the panel; the window was
open, but the interior was obscure; the driver yawned behind his
palm; and the young man was already beginning to suppose himself
the dupe of his own fancy, when a hand, no larger than a
child&rsquo;s and smoothly gloved in white, appeared in a corner
of the window and privily beckoned him to approach.&nbsp; He did
so, and looked in.&nbsp; The carriage was occupied by a single
small and very dainty figure, swathed head and shoulders in
impenetrable folds of white lace; and a voice, speaking low and
silvery, addressed him in these words&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Open the door and get in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must be,&rsquo; thought the young man with an almost
unbearable thrill, &lsquo;it must be that duchess at
last!&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet, although the moment was one to which he
had long looked forward, it was with a certain share of alarm
that he opened the door, and, mounting into the brougham, took
his seat beside the lady of the lace.&nbsp; Whether or no she had
touched a spring, or given some other signal, the young man had
hardly closed the door before the carriage, with considerable
swiftness, and with a very luxurious and easy movement on its
springs, turned and began to drive towards the west.</p>
<p>Somerset, as I have written, was not unprepared; it had long
been his particular pleasure to rehearse his conduct in the most
unlikely situations; and this, among others, of the patrician
ravisher, was one he had familiarly studied.&nbsp; Strange as it
may seem, however, he could find no apposite remark; and as the
lady, on her side, vouchsafed no further sign, they continued to
drive in silence through the streets.&nbsp; Except for alternate
flashes from the passing lamps, the carriage was plunged in
obscurity; and beyond the fact that the fittings were luxurious,
and that the lady was singularly small and slender in person,
and, all but one gloved hand, still swathed in her costly veil,
the young man could decipher no detail of an inspiring
nature.&nbsp; The suspense began to grow unbearable.&nbsp; Twice
he cleared his throat, and twice the whole resources of the
language failed him.&nbsp; In similar scenes, when he had
forecast them on the theatre of fancy, his presence of mind had
always been complete, his eloquence remarkable; and at this
disparity between the rehearsal and the performance, he began to
be seized with a panic of apprehension.&nbsp; Here, on the very
threshold of adventure, suppose him ignominiously to fail;
suppose that after ten, twenty, or sixty seconds of still
uninterrupted silence, the lady should touch the check-string and
re-deposit him, weighed and found wanting, on the common
street!&nbsp; Thousands of persons of no mind at all, he
reasoned, would be found more equal to the part; could, that very
instant, by some decisive step, prove the lady&rsquo;s choice to
have been well inspired, and put a stop to this intolerable
silence.</p>
<p>His eye, at this point, lighted on the hand.&nbsp; It was
better to fall by desperate councils than to continue as he was;
and with one tremulous swoop he pounced on the gloved fingers and
drew them to himself.&nbsp; One overt step, it had appeared to
him, would dissolve the spell of his embarrassment; in act, he
found it otherwise: he found himself no less incapable of speech
or further progress; and with the lady&rsquo;s hand in his, sat
helpless.&nbsp; But worse was in store.&nbsp; A peculiar
quivering began to agitate the form of his companion; the hand
that lay unresistingly in Somerset&rsquo;s trembled as with ague;
and presently there broke forth, in the shadow of the carriage,
the bubbling and musical sound of laughter, resisted but
triumphant.&nbsp; The young man dropped his prize; had it been
possible, he would have bounded from the carriage.&nbsp; The
lady, meanwhile, lying back upon the cushions, passed on from
trill to trill of the most heartfelt, high-pitched, clear and
fairy-sounding merriment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must not be offended,&rsquo; she said at last,
catching an opportunity between two paroxysms.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
you have been mistaken in the warmth of your attentions, the
fault is solely mine; it does not flow from your presumption, but
from my eccentric manner of recruiting friends; and, believe me,
I am the last person in the world to think the worse of a young
man for showing spirit.&nbsp; As for to-night, it is my intention
to entertain you to a little supper; and if I shall continue to
be as much pleased with your manners as I was taken with your
face, I may perhaps end by making you an advantageous
offer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somerset sought in vain to find some form of answer, but his
discomfiture had been too recent and complete.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; returned the lady, &lsquo;we must have no
display of temper; that is for me the one disqualifying fault;
and as I perceive we are drawing near our destination, I shall
ask you to descend and offer me your arm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, at that very moment the carriage drew up before a
stately and severe mansion in a spacious square; and Somerset,
who was possessed of an excellent temper, with the best grace in
the world assisted the lady to alight.&nbsp; The door was opened
by an old woman of a grim appearance, who ushered the pair into a
dining-room somewhat dimly lighted, but already laid for supper,
and occupied by a prodigious company of large and valuable
cats.&nbsp; Here, as soon as they were alone, the lady divested
herself of the lace in which she was enfolded; and Somerset was
relieved to find, that although still bearing the traces of great
beauty, and still distinguished by the fire and colour of her
eye, her hair was of a silvery whiteness and her face lined with
years.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now, <i>mon preux</i>,&rsquo; said the old lady,
nodding at him with a quaint gaiety, &lsquo;you perceive that I
am no longer in my first youth.&nbsp; You will soon find that I
am all the better company for that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, the maid re-entered the apartment with a light
but tasteful supper.&nbsp; They sat down, accordingly, to table,
the cats with savage pantomime surrounding the old lady&rsquo;s
chair; and what with the excellence of the meal and the gaiety of
his entertainer, Somerset was soon completely at his ease.&nbsp;
When they had well eaten and drunk, the old lady leaned back in
her chair, and taking a cat upon her lap, subjected her guest to
a prolonged but evidently mirthful scrutiny.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear, madam,&rsquo; said Somerset, &lsquo;that my
manners have not risen to the height of your preconceived
opinion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear young man,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;you were
never more mistaken in your life.&nbsp; I find you charming, and
you may very well have lighted on a fairy godmother.&nbsp; I am
not one of those who are given to change their opinions, and
short of substantial demerit, those who have once gained my
favour continue to enjoy it; but I have a singular swiftness of
decision, read my fellow men and women with a glance, and have
acted throughout life on first impressions.&nbsp; Yours, as I
tell you, has been favourable; and if, as I suppose, you are a
young fellow of somewhat idle habits, I think it not improbable
that we may strike a bargain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, madam,&rsquo; returned Somerset, &lsquo;you have
divined my situation.&nbsp; I am a man of birth, parts, and
breeding; excellent company, or at least so I find myself; but by
a peculiar iniquity of fate, destitute alike of trade or
money.&nbsp; I was, indeed, this evening upon the quest of an
adventure, resolved to close with any offer of interest,
emolument, or pleasure; and your summons, which I profess I am
still at some loss to understand, jumped naturally with the
inclination of my mind.&nbsp; Call it, if you will, impudence; I
am here, at least, prepared for any proposition you can find it
in your heart to make, and resolutely determined to
accept.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You express yourself very well,&rsquo; replied the old
lady, &lsquo;and are certainly a droll and curious young
man.&nbsp; I should not care to affirm that you were sane, for I
have never found any one entirely so besides myself; but at least
the nature of your madness entertains me, and I will reward you
with some description of my character and life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the old lady, still fondling the cat upon her lap,
proceeded to narrate the following particulars.</p>
<h3><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span><i>NARRATIVE OF THE SPIRITED OLD
LADY</i></h3>
<p>I was the eldest daughter of the Reverend Bernard Fanshawe,
who held a valuable living in the diocese of Bath and
Wells.&nbsp; Our family, a very large one, was noted for a
sprightly and incisive wit, and came of a good old stock where
beauty was an heirloom.&nbsp; In Christian grace of character we
were unhappily deficient.&nbsp; From my earliest years I saw and
deplored the defects of those relatives whose age and position
should have enabled them to conquer my esteem; and while I was
yet a child, my father married a second wife, in whom (strange to
say) the Fanshawe failings were exaggerated to a monstrous and
almost laughable degree.&nbsp; Whatever may be said against me,
it cannot be denied I was a pattern daughter; but it was in vain
that, with the most touching patience, I submitted to my
stepmother&rsquo;s demands; and from the hour she entered my
father&rsquo;s house, I may say that I met with nothing but
injustice and ingratitude.</p>
<p>I stood not alone, however, in the sweetness of my
disposition; for one other of the family besides myself was free
from any violence of character.&nbsp; Before I had reached the
age of sixteen, this cousin, John by name, had conceived for me a
sincere but silent passion; and although the poor lad was too
timid to hint at the nature of his feelings, I had soon divined
and begun to share them.&nbsp; For some days I pondered on the
odd situation created for me by the bashfulness of my admirer;
and at length, perceiving that he began, in his distress, rather
to avoid than seek my company, I determined to take the matter
into my own hands.&nbsp; Finding him alone in a retired part of
the rectory garden, I told him that I had divined his amiable
secret, that I knew with what disfavour our union was sure to be
regarded; and that, under the circumstances, I was prepared to
flee with him at once.&nbsp; Poor John was literally paralysed
with joy; such was the force of his emotions, that he could find
no words in which to thank me; and that I, seeing him thus
helpless, was obliged to arrange, myself, the details of our
flight, and of the stolen marriage which was immediately to crown
it.&nbsp; John had been at that time projecting a visit to the
metropolis.&nbsp; In this I bade him persevere, and promised on
the following day to join him at the Tavistock Hotel.</p>
<p>True, on my side, to every detail of our arrangement, I arose,
on the day in question, before the servants, packed a few
necessaries in a bag, took with me the little money I possessed,
and bade farewell for ever to the rectory.&nbsp; I walked with
good spirits to a town some thirty miles from home, and was set
down the next morning in this great city of London.&nbsp; As I
walked from the coach-office to the hotel, I could not help
exulting in the pleasant change that had befallen me; beholding,
meanwhile, with innocent delight, the traffic of the streets, and
depicting, in all the colours of fancy, the reception that
awaited me from John.&nbsp; But alas! when I inquired for Mr.
Fanshawe, the porter assured me there was no such gentleman among
the guests.&nbsp; By what channel our secret had leaked out, or
what pressure had been brought to bear on the too facile John, I
could never fathom.&nbsp; Enough that my family had triumphed;
that I found myself alone in London, tender in years, smarting
under the most sensible mortification, and by every sentiment of
pride and self-respect debarred for ever from my father&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>I rose under the blow, and found lodgings in the neighbourhood
of Euston Road, where, for the first time in my life, I tasted
the joys of independence.&nbsp; Three days afterwards, an
advertisement in the <i>Times</i> directed me to the office of a
solicitor whom I knew to be in my father&rsquo;s
confidence.&nbsp; There I was given the promise of a very
moderate allowance, and a distinct intimation that I must never
look to be received at home.&nbsp; I could not but resent so
cruel a desertion, and I told the lawyer it was a meeting I
desired as little as themselves.&nbsp; He smiled at my courageous
spirit, paid me the first quarter of my income, and gave me the
remainder of my personal effects, which had been sent to me,
under his care, in a couple of rather ponderous boxes.&nbsp; With
these I returned in triumph to my lodgings, more content with my
position than I should have thought possible a week before, and
fully determined to make the best of the future.</p>
<p>All went well for several months; and, indeed, it was my own
fault alone that ended this pleasant and secluded episode of
life.&nbsp; I have, I must confess, the fatal trick of spoiling
my inferiors.&nbsp; My landlady, to whom I had as usual been
overkind, impertinently called me in fault for some particular
too small to mention; and I, annoyed that I had allowed her the
freedom upon which she thus presumed, ordered her to leave my
presence.&nbsp; She stood a moment dumb, and then, recalling her
self-possession, &lsquo;Your bill,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;shall
be ready this evening, and to-morrow, madam, you shall leave my
house.&nbsp; See,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;that you are able to
pay what you owe me; for if I do not receive the uttermost
farthing, no box of yours shall pass my threshold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was confounded at her audacity, but as a whole
quarter&rsquo;s income was due to me, not otherwise affected by
the threat.&nbsp; That afternoon, as I left the solicitor&rsquo;s
door, carrying in one hand, and done up in a paper parcel, the
whole amount of my fortune, there befell me one of those decisive
incidents that sometimes shape a life.&nbsp; The lawyer&rsquo;s
office was situate in a street that opened at the upper end upon
the Strand, and was closed at the lower, at the time of which I
speak, by a row of iron railings looking on the Thames.&nbsp;
Down this street, then, I beheld my stepmother advancing to meet
me, and doubtless bound to the very house I had just left.&nbsp;
She was attended by a maid whose face was new to me, but her own
was too clearly printed on my memory; and the sight of it, even
from a distance, filled me with generous indignation.&nbsp;
Flight was impossible.&nbsp; There was nothing left but to
retreat against the railing, and with my back turned to the
street, pretend to be admiring the barges on the river or the
chimneys of transpontine London.</p>
<p>I was still so standing, and had not yet fully mastered the
turbulence of my emotions, when a voice at my elbow addressed me
with a trivial question.&nbsp; It was the maid whom my
stepmother, with characteristic hardness, had left to await her
on the street, while she transacted her business with the family
solicitor.&nbsp; The girl did not know who I was; the opportunity
too golden to be lost; and I was soon hearing the latest news of
my father&rsquo;s rectory and parish.&nbsp; It did not surprise
me to find that she detested her employers; and yet the terms in
which she spoke of them were hard to bear, hard to let pass
unchallenged.&nbsp; I heard them, however, without dissent, for
my self-command is wonderful; and we might have parted as we met,
had she not proceeded, in an evil hour, to criticise the
rector&rsquo;s missing daughter, and with the most shocking
perversions, to narrate the story of her flight.&nbsp; My nature
is so essentially generous that I can never pause to
reason.&nbsp; I flung up my hand sharply, by way, as well as I
remember, of indignant protest; and, in the act, the packet
slipped from my fingers, glanced between the railings, and fell
and sunk in the river.&nbsp; I stood a moment petrified, and
then, struck by the drollery of the incident, gave way to peals
of laughter.&nbsp; I was still laughing when my stepmother
reappeared, and the maid, who doubtless considered me insane, ran
off to join her; nor had I yet recovered my gravity when I
presented myself before the lawyer to solicit a fresh
advance.&nbsp; His answer made me serious enough, for it was a
flat refusal; and it was not until I had besought him even with
tears, that he consented to lend me ten pounds from his own
pocket.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am a poor man,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and
you must look for nothing farther at my hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The landlady met me at the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here,
madam,&rsquo; said she, with a curtsey insolently low,
&lsquo;here is my bill.&nbsp; Would it inconvenience you to
settle it at once?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shall be paid, madam,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;in the
morning, in the proper course.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I took the paper
with a very high air, but inwardly quaking.</p>
<p>I had no sooner looked at it than I perceived myself to be
lost.&nbsp; I had been short of money and had allowed my debt to
mount; and it had now reached the sum, which I shall never
forget, of twelve pounds thirteen and fourpence halfpenny.&nbsp;
All evening I sat by the fire considering my situation.&nbsp; I
could not pay the bill; my landlady would not suffer me to remove
my boxes; and without either baggage or money, how was I to find
another lodging?&nbsp; For three months, unless I could invent
some remedy, I was condemned to be without a roof and without a
penny.&nbsp; It can surprise no one that I decided on immediate
flight; but even here I was confronted by a difficulty, for I had
no sooner packed my boxes than I found I was not strong enough to
move, far less to carry them.</p>
<p>In this strait I did not hesitate a moment, but throwing on a
shawl and bonnet, and covering my face with a thick veil, I
betook myself to that great bazaar of dangerous and smiling
chances, the pavement of the city.&nbsp; It was already late at
night, and the weather being wet and windy, there were few abroad
besides policemen.&nbsp; These, on my present mission, I had wit
enough to know for enemies; and wherever I perceived their moving
lanterns, I made haste to turn aside and choose another
thoroughfare.&nbsp; A few miserable women still walked the
pavement; here and there were young fellows returning drunk, or
ruffians of the lowest class lurking in the mouths of alleys; but
of any one to whom I might appeal in my distress, I began almost
to despair.</p>
<p>At last, at the corner of a street, I ran into the arms of one
who was evidently a gentleman, and who, in all his appointments,
from his furred great-coat to the fine cigar which he was
smoking, comfortably breathed of wealth.&nbsp; Much as my face
has changed from its original beauty, I still retain (or so I
tell myself) some traces of the youthful lightness of my
figure.&nbsp; Even veiled as I then was, I could perceive the
gentleman was struck by my appearance: and this emboldened me for
my adventure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said I, with a quickly beating heart,
&lsquo;sir, are you one in whom a lady can confide?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, my dear,&rsquo; said he, removing his cigar,
&lsquo;that depends on circumstances.&nbsp; If you will raise
your veil&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; I interrupted, &lsquo;let there be no
mistake.&nbsp; I ask you, as a gentleman, to serve me, but I
offer no reward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is frank,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;but hardly
tempting.&nbsp; And what, may I inquire, is the nature of the
service?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But I knew well enough it was not my interest to tell him on
so short an interview.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you will accompany
me,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;to a house not far from here, you can
see for yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me awhile with hesitating eyes; and then, tossing
away his cigar, which was not yet a quarter smoked, &lsquo;Here
goes!&rsquo; said he, and with perfect politeness offered me his
arm.&nbsp; I was wise enough to take it; to prolong our walk as
far as possible, by more than one excursion from the shortest
line; and to beguile the way with that sort of conversation which
should prove to him indubitably from what station in society I
sprang.&nbsp; By the time we reached the door of my lodging, I
felt sure I had confirmed his interest, and might venture, before
I turned the pass-key, to beseech him to moderate his voice and
to tread softly.&nbsp; He promised to obey me: and I admitted him
into the passage and thence into my sitting-room, which was
fortunately next the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said he, when with trembling fingers I
had lighted a candle, &lsquo;what is the meaning of all
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you,&rsquo; said I, speaking with great
difficulty, &lsquo;to help me out with these boxes&mdash;and I
wish nobody to know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took up the candle.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I wish to see your
face,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>I turned back my veil without a word, and looked at him with
every appearance of resolve that I could summon up.&nbsp; For
some time he gazed into my face, still holding up the
candle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he at last, &lsquo;and
where do you wish them taken?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I knew that I had gained my point; and it was with a tremor in
my voice that I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had thought we might
carry them between us to the corner of Euston Road,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;where, even at this late hour, we may still find a
cab.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; was his reply; and he immediately
hoisted the heavier of my trunks upon his shoulder, and taking
one handle of the second, signed to me to help him at the other
end.&nbsp; In this order we made good our retreat from the house,
and without the least adventure, drew pretty near to the corner
of Euston Road.&nbsp; Before a house, where there was a light
still burning, my companion paused.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let us
here,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;set down our boxes, while we go
forward to the end of the street in quest of a cab.&nbsp; By
doing so, we can still keep an eye upon their safety, and we
avoid the very extraordinary figure we should otherwise
present&mdash;a young man, a young lady, and a mass of baggage,
standing castaway at midnight on the streets of
London.&rsquo;&nbsp; So it was done, and the event proved him to
be wise; for long before there was any word of a cab, a policeman
appeared upon the scene, turned upon us the full glare of his
lantern, and hung suspiciously behind us in a doorway.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There seem to be no cabs about, policeman,&rsquo; said
my champion, with affected cheerfulness.&nbsp; But the
constable&rsquo;s answer was ungracious; and as for the offer of
a cigar, with which this rebuff was most unwisely followed up, he
refused it point-blank, and without the least civility.&nbsp; The
young gentleman looked at me with a warning grimace, and there we
continued to stand, on the edge of the pavement, in the beating
rain, and with the policeman still silently watching our
movements from the doorway.</p>
<p>At last, and after a delay that seemed interminable, a
four-wheeler appeared lumbering along in the mud, and was
instantly hailed by my companion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Just pull up here,
will you?&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have some baggage up
the street.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And now came the hitch of our adventure; for when the
policeman, still closely following us, beheld my two boxes lying
in the rain, he arose from mere suspicion to a kind of certitude
of something evil.&nbsp; The light in the house had been
extinguished; the whole frontage of the street was dark; there
was nothing to explain the presence of these unguarded trunks;
and no two innocent people were ever, I believe, detected in such
questionable circumstances.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where have these things come from?&rsquo; asked the
policeman, flashing his light full into my champion&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, from that house, of course,&rsquo; replied the
young gentleman, hastily shouldering a trunk.</p>
<p>The policeman whistled and turned to look at the dark windows;
he then took a step towards the door, as though to knock, a
course which had infallibly proved our ruin; but seeing us
already hurrying down the street under our double burthen,
thought better or worse of it, and followed in our wake.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; whispered my companion,
&lsquo;tell me where to drive to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anywhere,&rsquo; I replied with anguish.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have no idea.&nbsp; Anywhere you like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus it befell that, when the boxes had been stowed, and I had
already entered the cab, my deliverer called out in clear tones
the address of the house in which we are now seated.&nbsp; The
policeman, I could see, was staggered.&nbsp; This neighbourhood,
so retired, so aristocratic, was far from what he had
expected.&nbsp; For all that, he took the number of the cab, and
spoke for a few seconds and with a decided manner in the
cabman&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What can he have said?&rsquo; I gasped, as soon as the
cab had rolled away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can very well imagine,&rsquo; replied my champion;
&lsquo;and I can assure you that you are now condemned to go
where I have said; for, should we attempt to change our
destination by the way, the jarvey will drive us straight to a
police-office.&nbsp; Let me compliment you on your nerves,&rsquo;
he added.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have had, I believe, the most horrible
fright of my existence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But my nerves, which he so much misjudged, were in so strange
a disarray that speech was now become impossible; and we made the
drive thenceforward in unbroken silence.&nbsp; When we arrived
before the door of our destination, the young gentleman alighted,
opened it with a pass-key like one who was at home, bade the
driver carry the trunks into the hall, and dismissed him with a
handsome fee.&nbsp; He then led me into this dining-room, looking
nearly as you behold it, but with certain marks of bachelor
occupancy, and hastened to pour out a glass of wine, which he
insisted on my drinking.&nbsp; As soon as I could find my voice,
&lsquo;In God&rsquo;s name,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;where am
I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He told me I was in his house, where I was very welcome, and
had no more urgent business than to rest myself and recover my
spirits.&nbsp; As he spoke he offered me another glass of wine,
of which, indeed, I stood in great want, for I was faint, and
inclined to be hysterical.&nbsp; Then he sat down beside the
fire, lit another cigar, and for some time observed me curiously
in silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that you have somewhat
restored yourself, will you be kind enough to tell me in what
sort of crime I have become a partner?&nbsp; Are you murderer,
smuggler, thief, or only the harmless and domestic moonlight
flitter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had been already shocked by his lighting a cigar without
permission, for I had not forgotten the one he threw away on our
first meeting; and now, at these explicit insults, I resolved at
once to reconquer his esteem.&nbsp; The judgment of the world I
have consistently despised, but I had already begun to set a
certain value on the good opinion of my entertainer.&nbsp;
Beginning with a note of pathos, but soon brightening into my
habitual vivacity and humour, I rapidly narrated the
circumstances of my birth, my flight, and subsequent
misfortunes.&nbsp; He heard me to an end in silence, gravely
smoking.&nbsp; &lsquo;Miss Fanshawe,&rsquo; said he, when I had
done, &lsquo;you are a very comical and most enchanting creature;
and I can see nothing for it but that I should return to-morrow
morning and satisfy your landlady&rsquo;s demands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You strangely misinterpret my confidence,&rsquo; was my
reply; &lsquo;and if you had at all appreciated my character, you
would understand that I can take no money at your
hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your landlady will doubtless not be so
particular,&rsquo; he returned; &lsquo;nor do I at all despair of
persuading even your unconquerable self.&nbsp; I desire you to
examine me with critical indulgence.&nbsp; My name is Henry
Luxmore, Lord Southwark&rsquo;s second son.&nbsp; I possess nine
thousand a year, the house in which we are now sitting, and seven
others in the best neighbourhoods in town.&nbsp; I do not believe
I am repulsive to the eye, and as for my character, you have seen
me under trial.&nbsp; I think you simply the most original of
created beings; I need not tell you what you know very well, that
you are ravishingly pretty; and I have nothing more to add,
except that, foolish as it may appear, I am already head over
heels in love with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I am prepared to be
misjudged; but while I continue to accept your hospitality that
fact alone should be enough to protect me from insult.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo; said he: &lsquo;I offer you
marriage.&rsquo;&nbsp; And leaning back in his chair he replaced
his cigar between his lips.</p>
<p>I own I was confounded by an offer, not only so unprepared,
but couched in terms so singular.&nbsp; But he knew very well how
to obtain his purposes, for he was not only handsome in person,
but his very coolness had a charm; and to make a long story
short, a fortnight later I became the wife of the Honourable
Henry Luxmore.</p>
<p>For nearly twenty years I now led a life of almost perfect
quiet.&nbsp; My Henry had his weaknesses; I was twice driven to
flee from his roof, but not for long; for though he was easily
over-excited, his nature was placable below the surface, and with
all his faults, I loved him tenderly.&nbsp; At last he was taken
from me; and such is the power of self-deception, and so strange
are the whims of the dying, he actually assured me, with his
latest breath, that he forgave the violence of my temper!</p>
<p>There was but one pledge of the marriage, my daughter
Clara.&nbsp; She had, indeed, inherited a shadow of her
father&rsquo;s failing; but in all things else, unless my partial
eyes deceived me, she derived her qualities from me, and might be
called my moral image.&nbsp; On my side, whatever else I may have
done amiss, as a mother I was above reproach.&nbsp; Here, then,
was surely every promise for the future; here, at last, was a
relation in which I might hope to taste repose.&nbsp; But it was
not to be.&nbsp; You will hardly credit me when I inform you that
she ran away from home; yet such was the case.&nbsp; Some whim
about oppressed nationalities&mdash;Ireland, Poland, and the
like&mdash;has turned her brain; and if you should anywhere
encounter a young lady (I must say, of remarkable attractions)
answering to the name of Luxmore, Lake, or Fonblanque (for I am
told she uses these indifferently, as well as many others), tell
her, from me, that I forgive her cruelty, and though I will never
more behold her face, I am at any time prepared to make her a
liberal allowance.</p>
<p>On the death of Mr. Luxmore, I sought oblivion in the details
of business.&nbsp; I believe I have mentioned that seven
mansions, besides this, formed part of Mr. Luxmore&rsquo;s
property: I have found them seven white elephants.&nbsp; The
greed of tenants, the dishonesty of solicitors, and the
incapacity that sits upon the bench, have combined together to
make these houses the burthen of my life.&nbsp; I had no sooner,
indeed, begun to look into these matters for myself, than I
discovered so many injustices and met with so much studied
incivility, that I was plunged into a long series of lawsuits,
some of which are pending to this day.&nbsp; You must have heard
my name already; I am the Mrs. Luxmore of the Law Reports: a
strange destiny, indeed, for one born with an almost cowardly
desire for peace!&nbsp; But I am of the stamp of those who, when
they have once begun a task, will rather die than leave their
duty unfulfilled.&nbsp; I have met with every obstacle: insolence
and ingratitude from my own lawyers; in my adversaries, that
fault of obstinacy which is to me perhaps the most distasteful in
the calendar; from the bench, civility indeed&mdash;always, I
must allow, civility&mdash;but never a spark of independence,
never that knowledge of the law and love of justice which we have
a right to look for in a judge, the most august of human
officers.&nbsp; And still, against all these odds, I have
undissuadably persevered.</p>
<p>It was after the loss of one of my innumerable cases (a
subject on which I will not dwell) that it occurred to me to make
a melancholy pilgrimage to my various houses.&nbsp; Four were at
that time tenantless and closed, like pillars of salt,
commemorating the corruption of the age and the decline of
private virtue.&nbsp; Three were occupied by persons who had
wearied me by every conceivable unjust demand and legal
subterfuge&mdash;persons whom, at that very hour, I was moving
heaven and earth to turn into the street.&nbsp; This was perhaps
the sadder spectacle of the two; and my heart grew hot within me
to behold them occupying, in my very teeth, and with an insolent
ostentation, these handsome structures which were as much mine as
the flesh upon my body.</p>
<p>One more house remained for me to visit, that in which we now
are.&nbsp; I had let it (for at that period I lodged in a hotel,
the life that I have always preferred) to a Colonel Geraldine, a
gentleman attached to Prince Florizel of Bohemia, whom you must
certainly have heard of; and I had supposed, from the character
and position of my tenant, that here, at least, I was safe
against annoyance.&nbsp; What was my surprise to find this house
also shuttered and apparently deserted!&nbsp; I will not deny
that I was offended; I conceived that a house, like a yacht, was
better to be kept in commission; and I promised myself to bring
the matter before my solicitor the following morning.&nbsp;
Meanwhile the sight recalled my fancy naturally to the past; and
yielding to the tender influence of sentiment, I sat down
opposite the door upon the garden parapet.&nbsp; It was August,
and a sultry afternoon, but that spot is sheltered, as you may
observe by daylight, under the branches of a spreading chestnut;
the square, too, was deserted; there was a sound of distant music
in the air; and all combined to plunge me into that most
agreeable of states, which is neither happiness nor sorrow, but
shares the poignancy of both.</p>
<p>From this I was recalled by the arrival of a large van, very
handsomely appointed, drawn by valuable horses, mounted by
several men of an appearance more than decent, and bearing on its
panels, instead of a trader&rsquo;s name, a coat-of-arms too
modest to be deciphered from where I sat.&nbsp; It drew up before
my house, the door of which was immediately opened by one of the
men.&nbsp; His companions&mdash;I counted seven of them in
all&mdash;proceeded, with disciplined activity, to take from the
van and carry into the house a variety of hampers,
bottle-baskets, and boxes, such as are designed for plate and
napery.&nbsp; The windows of the dining-room were thrown widely
open, as though to air it; and I saw some of those within laying
the table for a meal.&nbsp; Plainly, I concluded, my tenant was
about to return; and while still determined to submit to no
aggression on my rights, I was gratified by the number and
discipline of his attendants, and the quiet profusion that
appeared to reign in his establishment.&nbsp; I was still so
thinking when, to my extreme surprise, the windows and shutters
of the dining-room were once more closed; the men began to
reappear from the interior and resume their stations on the van;
the last closed the door behind his exit; the van drove away; and
the house was once more left to itself, looking blindly on the
square with shuttered windows, as though the whole affair had
been a vision.</p>
<p>It was no vision, however; for, as I rose to my feet, and thus
brought my eyes a little nearer to the level of the fanlight over
the door, I saw that, though the day had still some hours to run,
the hall lamps had been lighted and left burning.&nbsp; Plainly,
then, guests were expected, and were not expected before
night.&nbsp; For whom, I asked myself with indignation, were such
secret preparations likely to be made?&nbsp; Although no prude, I
am a woman of decided views upon morality; if my house, to which
my husband had brought me, was to serve in the character of a
<i>petite maison</i>, I saw myself forced, however unwillingly,
into a new course of litigation; and, determined to return and
know the worst, I hastened to my hotel for dinner.</p>
<p>I was at my post by ten.&nbsp; The night was clear and quiet;
the moon rode very high and put the lamps to shame; and the
shadow below the chestnut was black as ink.&nbsp; Here, then, I
ensconced myself on the low parapet, with my back against the
railings, face to face with the moonlit front of my old home, and
ruminating gently on the past.&nbsp; Time fled; eleven struck on
all the city clocks; and presently after I was aware of the
approach of a gentleman of stately and agreeable demeanour.&nbsp;
He was smoking as he walked; his light palet&ocirc;t, which was
open, did not conceal his evening clothes; and he bore himself
with a serious grace that immediately awakened my
attention.&nbsp; Before the door of this house he took a pass-key
from his pocket, quietly admitted himself, and disappeared into
the lamplit hall.</p>
<p>He was scarcely gone when I observed another and a much
younger man approaching hastily from the opposite side of the
square.&nbsp; Considering the season of the year and the genial
mildness of the night, he was somewhat closely muffled up; and as
he came, for all his hurry, he kept looking nervously behind
him.&nbsp; Arrived before my door, he halted and set one foot
upon the step, as though about to enter; then, with a sudden
change, he turned and began to hurry away; halted a second time,
as if in painful indecision; and lastly, with a violent gesture,
wheeled about, returned straight to the door, and rapped upon the
knocker.&nbsp; He was almost immediately admitted by the first
arrival.</p>
<p>My curiosity was now broad awake.&nbsp; I made myself as small
as I could in the very densest of the shadow, and waited for the
sequel.&nbsp; Nor had I long to wait.&nbsp; From the same side of
the square a second young man made his appearance, walking slowly
and softly, and like the first, muffled to the nose.&nbsp; Before
the house he paused, looked all about him with a swift and
comprehensive glance; and seeing the square lie empty in the moon
and lamplight, leaned far across the area railings and appeared
to listen to what was passing in the house.&nbsp; From the
dining-room there came the report of a champagne cork, and
following upon that, the sound of rich and manly laughter.&nbsp;
The listener took heart of grace, produced a key, unlocked the
area gate, shut it noiselessly behind him, and descended the
stair.&nbsp; Just when his head had reached the level of the
pavement, he turned half round and once more raked the square
with a suspicious eyeshot.&nbsp; The mufflings had fallen lower
round his neck; the moon shone full upon him; and I was startled
to observe the pallor and passionate agitation of his face.</p>
<p>I could remain no longer passive.&nbsp; Persuaded that
something deadly was afoot, I crossed the roadway and drew near
the area railings.&nbsp; There was no one below; the man must
therefore have entered the house, with what purpose I dreaded to
imagine.&nbsp; I have at no part of my career lacked courage; and
now, finding the area gate was merely laid to, I pushed it gently
open and descended the stairs.&nbsp; The kitchen door of the
house, like the area gate, was closed but not fastened.&nbsp; It
flashed upon me that the criminal was thus preparing his escape;
and the thought, as it confirmed the worst of my suspicions, lent
me new resolve.&nbsp; I entered the house; and being now quite
reckless of my life, I shut and locked the door.</p>
<p>From the dining-room above I could hear the pleasant tones of
a voice in easy conversation.&nbsp; On the ground floor all was
not only profoundly silent, but the darkness seemed to weigh upon
my eyes.&nbsp; Here, then, I stood for some time, having thrust
myself uncalled into the utmost peril, and being destitute of any
power to help or interfere.&nbsp; Nor will I deny that fear had
begun already to assail me, when I became aware, all at once and
as though by some immediate but silent incandescence, of a
certain glimmering of light upon the passage floor.&nbsp; Towards
this I groped my way with infinite precaution; and having come at
length as far as the angle of the corridor, beheld the door of
the butler&rsquo;s pantry standing just ajar and a narrow thread
of brightness falling from the chink.&nbsp; Creeping still
closer, I put my eye to the aperture.&nbsp; The man sat within
upon a chair, listening, I could see, with the most rapt
attention.&nbsp; On a table before him he had laid a watch, a
pair of steel revolvers, and a bull&rsquo;s-eye lantern.&nbsp;
For one second many contradictory theories and projects whirled
together in my head; the next, I had slammed the door and turned
the key upon the malefactor.&nbsp; Surprised at my own decision,
I stood and panted, leaning on the wall.&nbsp; From within the
pantry not a sound was to be heard; the man, whatever he was, had
accepted his fate without a struggle, and now, as I hugged myself
to fancy, sat frozen with terror and looking for the worst to
follow.&nbsp; I promised myself that he should not be
disappointed; and the better to complete my task, I turned to
ascend the stairs.</p>
<p>The situation, as I groped my way to the first floor, appealed
to me suddenly by my strong sense of humour.&nbsp; Here was I,
the owner of the house, burglariously present in its walls; and
there, in the dining-room, were two gentlemen, unknown to me,
seated complacently at supper, and only saved by my promptitude
from some surprising or deadly interruption.&nbsp; It were
strange if I could not manage to extract the matter of amusement
from so unusual a situation.</p>
<p>Behind this dining-room, there is a small apartment intended
for a library.&nbsp; It was to this that I cautiously groped my
way; and you will see how fortune had exactly served me.&nbsp;
The weather, I have said, was sultry; in order to ventilate the
dining-room and yet preserve the uninhabited appearance of the
mansion to the front, the window of the library had been widely
opened, and the door of communication between the two apartments
left ajar.&nbsp; To this interval I now applied my eye.</p>
<p>Wax tapers, set in silver candlesticks, shed their chastened
brightness on the damask of the tablecloth and the remains of a
cold collation of the rarest delicacy.&nbsp; The two gentlemen
had finished supper, and were now trifling with cigars and
maraschino; while in a silver spirit lamp, coffee of the most
captivating fragrance was preparing in the fashion of the
East.&nbsp; The elder of the two, he who had first arrived, was
placed directly facing me; the other was set on his left
hand.&nbsp; Both, like the man in the butler&rsquo;s pantry,
seemed to be intently listening; and on the face of the second I
thought I could perceive the marks of fear.&nbsp; Oddly enough,
however, when they came to speak, the parts were found to be
reversed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I assure you,&rsquo; said the elder gentleman, &lsquo;I
not only heard the slamming of a door, but the sound of very
guarded footsteps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your highness was certainly deceived,&rsquo; replied
the other.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am endowed with the acutest hearing,
and I can swear that not a mouse has rustled.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet
the pallor and contraction of his features were in total discord
with the tenor of his words.</p>
<p>His highness (whom, of course, I readily divined to be Prince
Florizel) looked at his companion for the least fraction of a
second; and though nothing shook the easy quiet of his attitude,
I could see that he was far from being duped.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is
well,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;let us dismiss the topic.&nbsp; And
now, sir, that I have very freely explained the sentiments by
which I am directed, let me ask you, according to your promise,
to imitate my frankness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have heard you,&rsquo; replied the other, &lsquo;with
great interest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With singular patience,&rsquo; said the prince
politely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, your highness, and with unlooked-for
sympathy,&rsquo; returned the young man.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know not
how to tell the change that has befallen me.&nbsp; You have, I
must suppose, a charm, to which even your enemies are
subject.&rsquo;&nbsp; He looked at the clock on the mantelpiece
and visibly blanched.&nbsp; &lsquo;So late!&rsquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your highness&mdash;God knows I am now
speaking from the heart&mdash;before it be too late, leave this
house!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The prince glanced once more at his companion, and then very
deliberately shook the ash from his cigar.&nbsp; &lsquo;That is a
strange remark,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;and <i>&aacute; propos de
bottes</i>, I never continue a cigar when once the ash is fallen;
the spell breaks, the soul of the flavour flies away, and there
remains but the dead body of tobacco; and I make it a rule to
throw away that husk and choose another.&rsquo;&nbsp; He suited
the action to the words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not trifle with my appeal,&rsquo; resumed the young
man, in tones that trembled with emotion.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is made
at the price of my honour and to the peril of my life.&nbsp;
Go&mdash;go now! lose not a moment; and if you have any kindness
for a young man, miserably deceived indeed, but not devoid of
better sentiments, look not behind you as you leave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said the prince, &lsquo;I am here upon your
honour; assure you upon mine that I shall continue to rely upon
that safeguard.&nbsp; The coffee is ready; I must again trouble
you, I fear.&rsquo;&nbsp; And with a courteous movement of the
hand, he seemed to invite his companion to pour out the
coffee.</p>
<p>The unhappy young man rose from his seat.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
appeal to you,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;by every holy sentiment,
in mercy to me, if not in pity to yourself, begone before it is
too late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; replied the prince, &lsquo;I am not readily
accessible to fear; and if there is one defect to which I must
plead guilty, it is that of a curious disposition.&nbsp; You go
the wrong way about to make me leave this house, in which I play
the part of your entertainer; and, suffer me to add, young man,
if any peril threaten us, it was of your contriving, not of
mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alas, you do not know to what you condemn me,&rsquo;
cried the other.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I at least will have no hand in
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; With these words he carried his hand to his
pocket, hastily swallowed the contents of a phial, and, with the
very act, reeled back and fell across his chair upon the
floor.&nbsp; The prince left his place and came and stood above
him, where he lay convulsed upon the carpet.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor
moth!&rsquo; I heard his highness murmur.&nbsp; &lsquo;Alas, poor
moth! must we again inquire which is the more
fatal&mdash;weakness or wickedness?&nbsp; And can a sympathy with
ideas, surely not ignoble in themselves, conduct a man to this
dishonourable death?&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time I had pushed the door open and walked into the
room.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your highness,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;this is
no time for moralising; with a little promptness we may save this
creature&rsquo;s life; and as for the other, he need cause you no
concern, for I have him safely under lock and key.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The prince had turned about upon my entrance, and regarded me
certainly with no alarm, but with a profundity of wonder which
almost robbed me of my self-possession.&nbsp; &lsquo;My dear
madam,&rsquo; he cried at last, &lsquo;and who the devil are
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was already on the floor beside the dying man.&nbsp; I had,
of course, no idea with what drug he had attempted his life, and
I was forced to try him with a variety of antidotes.&nbsp; Here
were both oil and vinegar, for the prince had done the young man
the honour of compounding for him one of his celebrated salads;
and of each of these I administered from a quarter to half a
pint, with no apparent efficacy.&nbsp; I next plied him with the
hot coffee, of which there may have been near upon a quart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you no milk?&rsquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear, madam, that milk has been omitted,&rsquo;
returned the prince.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Salt, then,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;salt is a
revulsive.&nbsp; Pass the salt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And possibly the mustard?&rsquo; asked his highness, as
he offered me the contents of the various salt-cellars poured
together on a plate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; cried I, &lsquo;the thought is
excellent!&nbsp; Mix me about half a pint of mustard, drinkably
dilute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whether it was the salt or the mustard, or the mere
combination of so many subversive agents, as soon as the last had
been poured over his throat, the young sufferer obtained
relief.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&rsquo; I exclaimed, with natural triumph,
&lsquo;I have saved a life!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet, madam,&rsquo; returned the prince, &lsquo;your
mercy may be cruelty disguised.&nbsp; Where the honour is lost,
it is, at least, superfluous to prolong the life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you had led a life as changeable as mine, your
highness,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;you would hold a very
different opinion.&nbsp; For my part, and after whatever
extremity of misfortune or disgrace, I should still count
to-morrow worth a trial.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You speak as a lady, madam,&rsquo; said the prince;
&lsquo;and for such you speak the truth.&nbsp; But to men there
is permitted such a field of license, and the good behaviour
asked of them is at once so easy and so little, that to fail in
that is to fall beyond the reach of pardon.&nbsp; But will you
suffer me to repeat a question, put to you at first, I am afraid,
with some defect of courtesy; and to ask you once more, who you
are and how I have the honour of your company?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am the proprietor of the house in which we
stand,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And still I am at fault,&rsquo; returned the
prince.</p>
<p>But at that moment the timepiece on the mantel-shelf began to
strike the hour of twelve; and the young man, raising himself
upon one elbow, with an expression of despair and horror that I
have never seen excelled, cried lamentably, &lsquo;Midnight! oh,
just God!&rsquo;&nbsp; We stood frozen to our places, while the
tingling hammer of the timepiece measured the remaining strokes;
nor had we yet stirred, so tragic had been the tones of the young
man, when the various bells of London began in turn to declare
the hour.&nbsp; The timepiece was inaudible beyond the walls of
the chamber where we stood; but the second pulsation of Big Ben
had scarcely throbbed into the night, before a sharp detonation
rang about the house.&nbsp; The prince sprang for the door by
which I had entered; but quick as he was, I yet contrived to
intercept him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you armed?&rsquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, madam,&rsquo; replied he.&nbsp; &lsquo;You remind
me appositely; I will take the poker.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The man below,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;has two
revolvers.&nbsp; Would you confront him at such odds?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He paused, as though staggered in his purpose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet, madam,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;we cannot
continue to remain in ignorance of what has passed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; cried I.&nbsp; &lsquo;And who proposes
it?&nbsp; I am as curious as yourself, but let us rather send for
the police; or, if your highness dreads a scandal, for some of
your own servants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, madam,&rsquo; he replied, smiling, &lsquo;for so
brave a lady, you surprise me.&nbsp; Would you have me, then,
send others where I fear to go myself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are perfectly right,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and I
was entirely wrong.&nbsp; Go, in God&rsquo;s name, and I will
hold the candle!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Together, therefore, we descended to the lower story, he
carrying the poker, I the light; and together we approached and
opened the door of the butler&rsquo;s pantry.&nbsp; In some sort,
I believe, I was prepared for the spectacle that met our eyes; I
was prepared, that is, to find the villain dead, but the rude
details of such a violent suicide I was unable to endure.&nbsp;
The prince, unshaken by horror as he had remained unshaken by
alarm, assisted me with the most respectful gallantry to regain
the dining-room.</p>
<p>There we found our patient, still, indeed, deadly pale, but
vastly recovered and already seated on a chair.&nbsp; He held out
both his hands with a most pitiful gesture of interrogation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is dead,&rsquo; said the prince.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; cried the young man, &lsquo;and it should
be I!&nbsp; What do I do, thus lingering on the stage I have
disgraced, while he, my sure comrade, blameworthy indeed for
much, but yet the soul of fidelity, has judged and slain himself
for an involuntary fault?&nbsp; Ah, sir,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;and you too, madam, without whose cruel help I should be
now beyond the reach of my accusing conscience, you behold in me
the victim equally of my own faults and virtues.&nbsp; I was born
a hater of injustice; from my most tender years my blood boiled
against heaven when I beheld the sick, and against men when I
witnessed the sorrows of the poor; the pauper&rsquo;s crust stuck
in my throat when I sat down to eat my dainties, and the cripple
child has set me weeping.&nbsp; What was there in that but what
was noble? and yet observe to what a fall these thoughts have led
me!&nbsp; Year after year this passion for the lost besieged me
closer.&nbsp; What hope was there in kings? what hope in these
well-feathered classes that now roll in money?&nbsp; I had
observed the course of history; I knew the burgess, our ruler of
to-day, to be base, cowardly, and dull; I saw him, in every age,
combine to pull down that which was immediately above and to prey
upon those that were below; his dulness, I knew, would ultimately
bring about his ruin; I knew his days were numbered, and yet how
was I to wait? how was I to let the poor child shiver in the
rain?&nbsp; The better days, indeed, were coming, but the child
would die before that.&nbsp; Alas, your highness, in surely no
ungenerous impatience I enrolled myself among the enemies of this
unjust and doomed society; in surely no unnatural desire to keep
the fires of my philanthropy alight, I bound myself by an
irrevocable oath.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That oath is all my history.&nbsp; To give freedom to
posterity I had forsworn my own.&nbsp; I must attend upon every
signal; and soon my father complained of my irregular hours and
turned me from his house.&nbsp; I was engaged in betrothal to an
honest girl; from her also I had to part, for she was too shrewd
to credit my inventions and too innocent to be entrusted with the
truth.&nbsp; Behold me, then, alone with conspirators!&nbsp;
Alas! as the years went on, my illusions left me.&nbsp;
Surrounded as I was by the fervent disciples and apologists of
revolution, I beheld them daily advance in confidence and
desperation; I beheld myself, upon the other hand, and with an
almost equal regularity, decline in faith.&nbsp; I had sacrificed
all to further that cause in which I still believed; and daily I
began to grow in doubts if we were advancing it indeed.&nbsp;
Horrible was the society with which we warred, but our own means
were not less horrible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not dwell upon my sufferings; I will not pause
to tell you how, when I beheld young men still free and happy,
married, fathers of children, cheerfully toiling at their work,
my heart reproached me with the greatness and vanity of my
unhappy sacrifice.&nbsp; I will not describe to you how, worn by
poverty, poor lodging, scanty food, and an unquiet conscience, my
health began to fail, and in the long nights, as I wandered
bedless in the rainy streets, the most cruel sufferings of the
body were added to the tortures of my mind.&nbsp; These things
are not personal to me; they are common to all unfortunates in my
position.&nbsp; An oath, so light a thing to swear, so grave a
thing to break: an oath, taken in the heat of youth, repented
with what sobbings of the heart, but yet in vain repented, as the
years go on: an oath, that was once the very utterance of the
truth of God, but that falls to be the symbol of a meaningless
and empty slavery; such is the yoke that many young men joyfully
assume, and under whose dead weight they live to suffer worse
than death.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not that I was patient.&nbsp; I have begged to be
released; but I knew too much, and I was still refused.&nbsp; I
have fled; ay, and for the time successfully.&nbsp; I reached
Paris.&nbsp; I found a lodging in the Rue St. Jacques, almost
opposite the Val de Gr&acirc;ce.&nbsp; My room was mean and bare,
but the sun looked into it towards evening; it commanded a peep
of a green garden; a bird hung by a neighbour&rsquo;s window and
made the morning beautiful; and I, who was sick, might lie in bed
and rest myself: I, who was in full revolt against the principles
that I had served, was now no longer at the beck of the council,
and was no longer charged with shameful and revolting
tasks.&nbsp; Oh! what an interval of peace was that!&nbsp; I
still dream, at times, that I can hear the note of my
neighbour&rsquo;s bird.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My money was running out, and it became necessary that
I should find employment.&nbsp; Scarcely had I been three days
upon the search, ere I thought that I was being followed.&nbsp; I
made certain of the features of the man, which were quite strange
to me, and turned into a small caf&eacute;, where I whiled away
an hour, pretending to read the papers, but inwardly convulsed
with terror.&nbsp; When I came forth again into the street, it
was quite empty, and I breathed again; but alas, I had not turned
three corners, when I once more observed the human hound pursuing
me.&nbsp; Not an hour was to be lost; timely submission might yet
preserve a life which otherwise was forfeit and dishonoured; and
I fled, with what speed you may conceive, to the Paris agency of
the society I served.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My submission was accepted.&nbsp; I took up once more
the hated burthen of that life; once more I was at the call of
men whom I despised and hated, while yet I envied and admired
them.&nbsp; They at least were wholehearted in the things they
purposed; but I, who had once been such as they, had fallen from
the brightness of my faith, and now laboured, like a hireling,
for the wages of a loathed existence.&nbsp; Ay, sir, to that I
was condemned; I obeyed to continue to live, and lived but to
obey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The last charge that was laid upon me was the one which
has to-night so tragically ended.&nbsp; Boldly telling who I was,
I was to request from your highness, on behalf of my society, a
private audience, where it was designed to murder you.&nbsp; If
one thing remained to me of my old convictions, it was the hate
of kings; and when this task was offered me, I took it
gladly.&nbsp; Alas, sir, you triumphed.&nbsp; As we supped, you
gained upon my heart.&nbsp; Your character, your talents, your
designs for our unhappy country, all had been
misrepresented.&nbsp; I began to forget you were a prince; I
began, all too feelingly, to remember that you were a man.&nbsp;
As I saw the hour approach, I suffered agonies untold; and when,
at last, we heard the slamming of the door which announced in my
unwilling ears the arrival of the partner of my crime, you will
bear me out with what instancy I besought you to depart.&nbsp;
You would not, alas! and what could I?&nbsp; Kill you, I could
not; my heart revolted, my hand turned back from such a
deed.&nbsp; Yet it was impossible that I should suffer you to
stay; for when the hour struck and my companion came, true to his
appointment, and he, at least, true to our design, I could
neither suffer you to be killed nor yet him to be arrested.&nbsp;
From such a tragic passage, death, and death alone, could save
me; and it is no fault of mine if I continue to exist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you, madam,&rsquo; continued the young man,
addressing himself more directly to myself, &lsquo;were doubtless
born to save the prince and to confound our purposes.&nbsp; My
life you have prolonged; and by turning the key on my companion,
you have made me the author of his death.&nbsp; He heard the hour
strike; he was impotent to help; and thinking himself forfeit to
honour, thinking that I should fall alone upon his highness and
perish for lack of his support, he has turned his pistol on
himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are right,&rsquo; said Prince Florizel: &lsquo;it
was in no ungenerous spirit that you brought these burthens on
yourself; and when I see you so nobly to blame, so tragically
punished, I stand like one reproved.&nbsp; For is it not strange,
madam, that you and I, by practising accepted and inconsiderable
virtues, and commonplace but still unpardonable faults, should
stand here, in the sight of God, with what we call clean hands
and quiet consciences; while this poor youth, for an error that I
could almost envy him, should be sunk beyond the reach of
hope?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; resumed the prince, turning to the young
man, &lsquo;I cannot help you; my help would but unchain the
thunderbolt that overhangs you; and I can but leave you
free.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, sir,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;as this house belongs
to me, I will ask you to have the kindness to remove the
body.&nbsp; You and your conspirators, it appears to me, can
hardly in civility do less.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It shall be done,&rsquo; said the young man, with a
dismal accent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you, dear madam,&rsquo; said the prince,
&lsquo;you, to whom I owe my life, how can I serve
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your highness,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;to be very plain,
this is my favourite house, being not only a valuable property,
but endeared to me by various associations.&nbsp; I have endless
troubles with tenants of the ordinary class: and at first
applauded my good fortune when I found one of the station of your
Master of the Horse.&nbsp; I now begin to think otherwise:
dangers set a siege about great personages; and I do not wish my
tenement to share these risks.&nbsp; Procure me the resiliation
of the lease, and I shall feel myself your debtor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must tell you, madam,&rsquo; replied his highness,
&lsquo;that Colonel Geraldine is but a cloak for myself; and I
should be sorry indeed to think myself so unacceptable a
tenant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your highness,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I have conceived a
sincere admiration for your character; but on the subject of
house property, I cannot allow the interference of my
feelings.&nbsp; I will, however, to prove to you that there is
nothing personal in my request, here solemnly engage my word that
I will never put another tenant in this house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; said Florizel, &lsquo;you plead your
cause too charmingly to be refused.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon we all three withdrew.&nbsp; The young man, still
reeling in his walk, departed by himself to seek the assistance
of his fellow-conspirators; and the prince, with the most
attentive gallantry, lent me his escort to the door of my
hotel.&nbsp; The next day, the lease was cancelled; nor from that
hour to this, though sometimes regretting my engagement, have I
suffered a tenant in this house.</p>

(<i>Continued</i>).</h2>
<p>As soon as the old lady had finished her relation, Somerset
made haste to offer her his compliments.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;your story is not only
entertaining but instructive; and you have told it with infinite
vivacity.&nbsp; I was much affected towards the end, as I held at
one time very liberal opinions, and should certainly have joined
a secret society if I had been able to find one.&nbsp; But the
whole tale came home to me; and I was the better able to feel for
you in your various perplexities, as I am myself of somewhat
hasty temper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not understand you,&rsquo; said Mrs. Luxmore, with
some marks of irritation.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must have strangely
misinterpreted what I have told you.&nbsp; You fill me with
surprise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somerset, alarmed by the old lady&rsquo;s change of tone and
manner, hurried to recant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Mrs. Luxmore,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you certainly
misconstrue my remark.&nbsp; As a man of somewhat fiery humour,
my conscience repeatedly pricked me when I heard what you had
suffered at the hands of persons similarly
constituted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, very well indeed,&rsquo; replied the old lady;
&lsquo;and a very proper spirit.&nbsp; I regret that I have met
with it so rarely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But in all this,&rsquo; resumed the young man, &lsquo;I
perceive nothing that concerns myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am about to come to that,&rsquo; she returned.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And you have already before you, in the pledge I gave
Prince Florizel, one of the elements of the affair.&nbsp; I am a
woman of the nomadic sort, and when I have no case before the
courts I make it a habit to visit continental spas: not that I
have ever been ill; but then I am no longer young, and I am
always happy in a crowd.&nbsp; Well, to come more shortly to the
point, I am now on the wing for Evian; this incubus of a house,
which I must leave behind and dare not let, hangs heavily upon my
hands; and I propose to rid myself of that concern, and do you a
very good turn into the bargain, by lending you the mansion, with
all its fittings, as it stands.&nbsp; The idea was sudden; it
appealed to me as humorous: and I am sure it will cause my
relatives, if they should ever hear of it, the keenest possible
chagrin.&nbsp; Here, then, is the key; and when you return at two
to-morrow afternoon, you will find neither me nor my cats to
disturb you in your new possession.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So saying, the old lady arose, as if to dismiss her visitor;
but Somerset, looking somewhat blankly on the key, began to
protest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Mrs. Luxmore,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;this is a
most unusual proposal.&nbsp; You know nothing of me, beyond the
fact that I displayed both impudence and timidity.&nbsp; I may be
the worst kind of scoundrel; I may sell your
furniture&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may blow up the house with gunpowder, for what I
care!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Luxmore.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is in vain to
reason.&nbsp; Such is the force of my character that, when I have
one idea clearly in my head, I do not care two straws for any
side consideration.&nbsp; It amuses me to do it, and let that
suffice.&nbsp; On your side, you may do what you please&mdash;let
apartments, or keep a private hotel; on mine, I promise you a
full month&rsquo;s warning before I return, and I never fail
religiously to keep my promises.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young man was about to renew his protest, when he observed
a sudden and significant change in the old lady&rsquo;s
countenance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I thought you capable of disrespect!&rsquo; she
cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; said Somerset, with the extreme fervour
of asseveration, &lsquo;madam, I accept.&nbsp; I beg you to
understand that I accept with joy and gratitude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah well,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Luxmore, &lsquo;if I am
mistaken, let it pass.&nbsp; And now, since all is comfortably
settled, I wish you a good-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, as if to leave him no room for repentance, she
hurried Somerset out of the front door, and left him standing,
key in hand, upon the pavement.</p>
<p>The next day, about the hour appointed, the young man found
his way to the square, which I will here call Golden Square,
though that was not its name.&nbsp; What to expect, he knew not;
for a man may live in dreams, and yet be unprepared for their
realisation.&nbsp; It was already with a certain pang of surprise
that he beheld the mansion, standing in the eye of day, a solid
among solids.&nbsp; The key, upon trial, readily opened the front
door; he entered that great house, a privileged burglar; and,
escorted by the echoes of desertion, rapidly reviewed the empty
chambers.&nbsp; Cats, servant, old lady, the very marks of
habitation, like writing on a slate, had been in these few hours
obliterated.&nbsp; He wandered from floor to floor, and found the
house of great extent; the kitchen offices commodious and well
appointed; the rooms many and large; and the drawing-room, in
particular, an apartment of princely size and tasteful
decoration.&nbsp; Although the day without was warm, genial, and
sunny, with a ruffling wind from the quarter of Torquay, a chill,
as it were, of suspended animation inhabited the house.&nbsp;
Dust and shadows met the eye; and but for the ominous procession
of the echoes, and the rumour of the wind among the garden trees,
the ear of the young man was stretched in vain.</p>
<p>Behind the dining-room, that pleasant library, referred to by
the old lady in her tale, looked upon the flat roofs and netted
cupolas of the kitchen quarters; and on a second visit, this room
appeared to greet him with a smiling countenance.&nbsp; He might
as well, he thought, avoid the expense of lodging: the library,
fitted with an iron bedstead which he had remarked, in one of the
upper chambers, would serve his purpose for the night; while in
the dining-room, which was large, airy, and lightsome, looking on
the square and garden, he might very agreeably pass his days,
cook his meals, and study to bring himself to some proficiency in
that art of painting which he had recently determined to
adopt.&nbsp; It did not take him long to make the change: he had
soon returned to the mansion with his modest kit; and the cabman
who brought him was readily induced, by the young man&rsquo;s
pleasant manner and a small gratuity, to assist him in the
installation of the iron bed.&nbsp; By six in the evening, when
Somerset went forth to dine, he was able to look back upon the
mansion with a sense of pride and property.&nbsp; Four-square it
stood, of an imposing frontage, and flanked on either side by
family hatchments.&nbsp; His eye, from where he stood whistling
in the key, with his back to the garden railings, reposed on
every feature of reality; and yet his own possession seemed as
flimsy as a dream.</p>
<p>In the course of a few days, the genteel inhabitants of the
square began to remark the customs of their neighbour.&nbsp; The
sight of a young gentleman discussing a clay pipe, about four
o&rsquo;clock of the afternoon, in the drawing-room balcony of so
discreet a mansion; and perhaps still more, his periodical
excursion to a decent tavern in the neighbourhood, and his
unabashed return, nursing the full tankard: had presently raised
to a high pitch the interest and indignation of the liveried
servants of the square.&nbsp; The disfavour of some of these
gentlemen at first proceeded to the length of insult; but
Somerset knew how to be affable with any class of men; and a few
rude words merrily accepted, and a few glasses amicably shared,
gained for him the right of toleration.</p>
<p>The young man had embraced the art of Raphael, partly from a
notion of its ease, partly from an inborn distrust of
offices.&nbsp; He scorned to bear the yoke of any regular
schooling; and proceeded to turn one half of the dining-room into
a studio for the reproduction of still life.&nbsp; There he
amassed a variety of objects, indiscriminately chosen from the
kitchen, the drawing-room, and the back garden; and there spent
his days in smiling assiduity.&nbsp; Meantime, the great bulk of
empty building overhead lay, like a load, upon his
imagination.&nbsp; To hold so great a stake and to do nothing,
argued some defect of energy; and he at length determined to act
upon the hint given by Mrs. Luxmore herself, and to stick, with
wafers, in the window of the dining-room, a small handbill
announcing furnished lodgings.&nbsp; At half-past six of a fine
July morning, he affixed the bill, and went forth into the square
to study the result.&nbsp; It seemed, to his eye, promising and
unpretentious; and he returned to the drawing-room balcony, to
consider, over a studious pipe, the knotty problem of how much he
was to charge.</p>
<p>Thereupon he somewhat relaxed in his devotion to the art of
painting.&nbsp; Indeed, from that time forth, he would spend the
best part of the day in the front balcony, like the attentive
angler poring on his float; and the better to support the tedium,
he would frequently console himself with his clay pipe.&nbsp; On
several occasions, passers-by appeared to be arrested by the
ticket, and on several others ladies and gentlemen drove to the
very doorstep by the carriageful; but it appeared there was
something repulsive in the appearance of the house; for with one
accord, they would cast but one look upward, and hastily resume
their onward progress or direct the driver to proceed.&nbsp;
Somerset had thus the mortification of actually meeting the eye
of a large number of lodging-seekers; and though he hastened to
withdraw his pipe, and to compose his features to an air of
invitation, he was never rewarded by so much as an inquiry.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Can there,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;be anything repellent
in myself?&rsquo;&nbsp; But a candid examination in one of the
pier-glasses of the drawing-room led him to dismiss the fear.</p>
<p>Something, however, was amiss.&nbsp; His vast and accurate
calculations on the fly-leaves of books, or on the backs of
playbills, appeared to have been an idle sacrifice of time.&nbsp;
By these, he had variously computed the weekly takings of the
house, from sums as modest as five-and-twenty shillings, up to
the more majestic figure of a hundred pounds; and yet, in despite
of the very elements of arithmetic, here he was making literally
nothing.</p>
<p>This incongruity impressed him deeply and occupied his
thoughtful leisure on the balcony; and at last it seemed to him
that he had detected the error of his method.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This,&rsquo; he reflected, &lsquo;is an age of generous
display: the age of the sandwich-man, of Griffiths, of
Pears&rsquo; legendary soap, and of Eno&rsquo;s fruit salt,
which, by sheer brass and notoriety, and the most disgusting
pictures I ever remember to have seen, has overlaid that
comforter of my childhood, Lamplough&rsquo;s pyretic
saline.&nbsp; Lamplough was genteel, Eno was omnipresent;
Lamplough was trite, Eno original and abominably vulgar; and here
have I, a man of some pretensions to knowledge of the world,
contented myself with half a sheet of note-paper, a few cold
words which do not directly address the imagination, and the
adornment (if adornment it may be called) of four red
wafers!&nbsp; Am I, then, to sink with Lamplough, or to soar with
Eno?&nbsp; Am I to adopt that modesty which is doubtless becoming
in a duke? or to take hold of the red facts of life with the
emphasis of the tradesman and the poet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pursuant upon these meditations, he procured several sheets of
the very largest size of drawing-paper; and laying forth his
paints, proceeded to compose an ensign that might attract the
eye, and at the same time, in his own phrase, directly address
the imagination of the passenger.&nbsp; Something taking in the
way of colour, a good, savoury choice of words, and a realistic
design setting forth the life a lodger might expect to lead
within the walls of that palace of delight: these, he perceived,
must be the elements of his advertisement.&nbsp; It was possible,
upon the one hand, to depict the sober pleasures of domestic
life, the evening fire, blond-headed urchins and the hissing urn;
but on the other, it was possible (and he almost felt as if it
were more suited to his muse) to set forth the charms of an
existence somewhat wider in its range or, boldly say, the
paradise of the Mohammedan.&nbsp; So long did the artist waver
between these two views, that, before he arrived at a conclusion,
he had finally conceived and completed both designs.&nbsp; With
the proverbially tender heart of the parent, he found himself
unable to sacrifice either of these offsprings of his art; and
decided to expose them on alternate days.&nbsp; &lsquo;In this
way,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;I shall address myself
indifferently to all classes of the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The tossing of a penny decided the only remaining point; and
the more imaginative canvas received the suffrages of fortune,
and appeared first in the window of the mansion.&nbsp; It was of
a high fancy, the legend eloquently writ, the scheme of colour
taking and bold; and but for the imperfection of the
artist&rsquo;s drawing, it might have been taken for a model of
its kind.&nbsp; As it was, however, when viewed from his
favourite point against the garden railings, and with some touch
of distance, it caused a pleasurable rising of the artist&rsquo;s
heart.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have thrown away,&rsquo; he ejaculated,
&lsquo;an invaluable motive; and this shall be the subject of my
first academy picture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fate of neither of these works was equal to its
merit.&nbsp; A crowd would certainly, from time to time, collect
before the area-railings; but they came to jeer and not to
speculate; and those who pushed their inquiries further, were too
plainly animated by the spirit of derision.&nbsp; The racier of
the two cartoons displayed, indeed, no symptom of attractive
merit; and though it had a certain share of that success called
scandalous, failed utterly of its effect.&nbsp; On the day,
however, of the second appearance of the companion work, a real
inquirer did actually present himself before the eyes of
Somerset.</p>
<p>This was a gentlemanly man, with some marks of recent
merriment, and his voice under inadequate control.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but what is
the meaning of your extraordinary bill?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg yours,&rsquo; returned Somerset hotly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Its meaning is sufficiently explicit.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
being now, from dire experience, fearful of ridicule, he was
preparing to close the door, when the gentleman thrust his cane
into the aperture.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so fast, I beg of you,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If you really let apartments, here is a possible tenant at
your door; and nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see
the accommodation and to learn your terms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His heart joyously beating, Somerset admitted the visitor,
showed him over the various apartments, and, with some return of
his persuasive eloquence, expounded their attractions.&nbsp; The
gentleman was particularly pleased by the elegant proportions of
the drawing-room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;would suit me very
well.&nbsp; What, may I ask, would be your terms a week, for this
floor and the one above it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was thinking,&rsquo; returned Somerset, &lsquo;of a
hundred pounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely not,&rsquo; exclaimed the gentleman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; returned Somerset,
&lsquo;fifty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman regarded him with an air of some
amazement.&nbsp; &lsquo;You seem to be strangely elastic in your
demands,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;What if I were to proceed
on your own principle of division, and offer
twenty-five?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Done!&rsquo; cried Somerset; and then, overcome by a
sudden embarrassment, &lsquo;You see,&rsquo; he added
apologetically, &lsquo;it is all found money for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really?&rsquo; said the stranger, looking at him all
the while with growing wonder.&nbsp; &lsquo;Without extras,
then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I suppose so,&rsquo; stammered the keeper of
the lodging-house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Service included?&rsquo; pursued the gentleman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Service?&rsquo; cried Somerset.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you
mean that you expect me to empty your slops?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman regarded him with a very friendly
interest.&nbsp; &lsquo;My dear fellow,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;if
you take my advice, you will give up this business.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And thereupon he resumed his hat and took himself away.</p>
<p>This smarting disappointment produced a strong effect on the
artist of the cartoons; and he began with shame to eat up his
rosier illusions.&nbsp; First one and then the other of his great
works was condemned, withdrawn from exhibition, and relegated, as
a mere wall-picture, to the decoration of the dining-room.&nbsp;
Their place was taken by a replica of the original wafered
announcement, to which, in particularly large letters, he had
added the pithy rubric: &lsquo;<i>No service</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Meanwhile he had fallen into something as nearly bordering on low
spirits as was consistent with his disposition; depressed, at
once by the failure of his scheme, the laughable turn of his late
interview, and the judicial blindness of the public to the merit
of the twin cartoons.</p>
<p>Perhaps a week had passed before he was again startled by the
note of the knocker.&nbsp; A gentleman of a somewhat foreign and
somewhat military air, yet closely shaven and wearing a soft hat,
desired in the politest terms to visit the apartments.&nbsp; He
had (he explained) a friend, a gentleman in tender health,
desirous of a sedate and solitary life, apart from interruptions
and the noises of the common lodging-house.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
unusual clause,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;in your announcement,
particularly struck me.&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;is the place for Mr. Jones.&rdquo;&nbsp; You are yourself,
sir, a professional gentleman?&rsquo; concluded the visitor,
looking keenly in Somerset&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am an artist,&rsquo; replied the young man
lightly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And these,&rsquo; observed the other, taking a side
glance through the open door of the dining-room, which they were
then passing, &lsquo;these are some of your works.&nbsp; Very
remarkable.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he again and still more sharply
peered into the countenance of the young man.</p>
<p>Somerset, unable to suppress a blush, made the more haste to
lead his visitor upstairs and to display the apartments.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excellent,&rsquo; observed the stranger, as he looked
from one of the back windows.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is that a mews behind,
sir?&nbsp; Very good.&nbsp; Well, sir: see here.&nbsp; My friend
will take your drawing-room floor; he will sleep in the back
drawing-room; his nurse, an excellent Irish widow, will attend on
all his wants and occupy a garret; he will pay you the round sum
of ten dollars a week; and you, on your part, will engage to
receive no other lodger?&nbsp; I think that fair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somerset had scarcely words in which to clothe his gratitude
and joy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Agreed,&rsquo; said the other; &lsquo;and to spare you
trouble, my friend will bring some men with him to make the
changes.&nbsp; You will find him a retiring inmate, sir; receives
but few, and rarely leaves the house, except at night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since I have been in this house,&rsquo; returned
Somerset, &lsquo;I have myself, unless it were to fetch beer,
rarely gone abroad except in the evening.&nbsp; But a man,&rsquo;
he added, &lsquo;must have some amusement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>An hour was then agreed on; the gentleman departed; and
Somerset sat down to compute in English money the value of the
figure named.&nbsp; The result of this investigation filled him
with amazement and disgust; but it was now too late; nothing
remained but to endure; and he awaited the arrival of his tenant,
still trying, by various arithmetical expedients, to obtain a
more favourable quotation for the dollar.&nbsp; With the approach
of dusk, however, his impatience drove him once more to the front
balcony.&nbsp; The night fell, mild and airless; the lamps shone
around the central darkness of the garden; and through the tall
grove of trees that intervened, many warmly illuminated windows
on the farther side of the square, told their tale of white
napery, choice wine, and genial hospitality.&nbsp; The stars were
already thickening overhead, when the young man&rsquo;s eyes
alighted on a procession of three four-wheelers, coasting round
the garden railing and bound for the Superfluous Mansion.&nbsp;
They were laden with formidable boxes; moved in a military order,
one following another; and, by the extreme slowness of their
advance, inspired Somerset with the most serious ideas of his
tenant&rsquo;s malady.</p>
<p>By the time he had the door open, the cabs had drawn up beside
the pavement; and from the two first, there had alighted the
military gentleman of the morning and two very stalwart
porters.&nbsp; These proceeded instantly to take possession of
the house; with their own hands, and firmly rejecting
Somerset&rsquo;s assistance, they carried in the various crates
and boxes; with their own hands dismounted and transferred to the
back drawing-room the bed in which the tenant was to sleep; and
it was not until the bustle of arrival had subsided, and the
arrangements were complete, that there descended, from the third
of the three vehicles, a gentleman of great stature and broad
shoulders, leaning on the shoulder of a woman in a widow&rsquo;s
dress, and himself covered by a long cloak and muffled in a
coloured comforter.</p>
<p>Somerset had but a glimpse of him in passing; he was soon shut
into the back drawing-room; the other men departed; silence
redescended on the house; and had not the nurse appeared a little
before half-past ten, and, with a strong brogue, asked if there
were a decent public-house in the neighbourhood, Somerset might
have still supposed himself to be alone in the Superfluous
Mansion.</p>
<p>Day followed day; and still the young man had never come by
speech or sight of his mysterious lodger.&nbsp; The doors of the
drawing-room flat were never open; and although Somerset could
hear him moving to and fro, the tall man had never quitted the
privacy of his apartments.&nbsp; Visitors, indeed, arrived;
sometimes in the dusk, sometimes at intempestuous hours of night
or morning; men, for the most part; some meanly attired, some
decently; some loud, some cringing; and yet all, in the eyes of
Somerset, displeasing.&nbsp; A certain air of fear and secrecy
was common to them all; they were all voluble, he thought, and
ill at ease; even the military gentleman proved, on a closer
inspection, to be no gentleman at all; and as for the doctor who
attended the sick man, his manners were not suggestive of a
university career.&nbsp; The nurse, again, was scarcely a
desirable house-fellow.&nbsp; Since her arrival, the fall of
whisky in the young man&rsquo;s private bottle was much
accelerated; and though never communicative, she was at times
unpleasantly familiar.&nbsp; When asked about the patient&rsquo;s
health, she would dolorously shake her head, and declare that the
poor gentleman was in a pitiful condition.</p>
<p>Yet somehow Somerset had early begun to entertain the notion
that his complaint was other than bodily.&nbsp; The ill-looking
birds that gathered to the house, the strange noises that sounded
from the drawing-room in the dead hours of night, the careless
attendance and intemperate habits of the nurse, the entire
absence of correspondence, the entire seclusion of Mr. Jones
himself, whose face, up to that hour, he could not have sworn to
in a court of justice&mdash;all weighed unpleasantly upon the
young man&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; A sense of something evil,
irregular and underhand, haunted and depressed him; and this
uneasy sentiment was the more firmly rooted in his mind, when, in
the fulness of time, he had an opportunity of observing the
features of his tenant.&nbsp; It fell in this way.&nbsp; The
young landlord was awakened about four in the morning by a noise
in the hall.&nbsp; Leaping to his feet, and opening the door of
the library, he saw the tall man, candle in hand, in earnest
conversation with the gentleman who had taken the rooms.&nbsp;
The faces of both were strongly illuminated; and in that of his
tenant, Somerset could perceive none of the marks of disease, but
every sign of health, energy, and resolution.&nbsp; While he was
still looking, the visitor took his departure; and the invalid,
having carefully fastened the front door, sprang upstairs without
a trace of lassitude.</p>
<p>That night upon his pillow, Somerset began to kindle once more
into the hot fit of the detective fever; and the next morning
resumed the practice of his art with careless hand and an
abstracted mind.&nbsp; The day was destined to be fertile in
surprises; nor had he long been seated at the easel ere the first
of these occurred.&nbsp; A cab laden with baggage drew up before
the door; and Mrs. Luxmore in person rapidly mounted the steps
and began to pound upon the knocker.&nbsp; Somerset hastened to
attend the summons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear fellow,&rsquo; she said, with the utmost
gaiety, &lsquo;here I come dropping from the moon.&nbsp; I am
delighted to find you faithful; and I have no doubt you will be
equally pleased to be restored to liberty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somerset could find no words, whether of protest or welcome;
and the spirited old lady pushed briskly by him and paused on the
threshold of the dining-room.&nbsp; The sight that met her eyes
was one well calculated to inspire astonishment.&nbsp; The
mantelpiece was arrayed with saucepans and empty bottles; on the
fire some chops were frying; the floor was littered from end to
end with books, clothes, walking-canes and the materials of the
painter&rsquo;s craft; but what far outstripped the other wonders
of the place was the corner which had been arranged for the study
of still-life.&nbsp; This formed a sort of rockery; conspicuous
upon which, according to the principles of the art of
composition, a cabbage was relieved against a copper kettle, and
both contrasted with the mail of a boiled lobster.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My gracious goodness!&rsquo; cried the lady of the
house; and then, turning in wrath on the young man, &lsquo;From
what rank in life are you sprung?&rsquo; she demanded.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You have the exterior of a gentleman; but from the
astonishing evidences before me, I should say you can only be a
greengrocer&rsquo;s man.&nbsp; Pray, gather up your vegetables,
and let me see no more of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; babbled Somerset, &lsquo;you promised me
a month&rsquo;s warning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was under a misapprehension,&rsquo; returned the
old lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;I now give you warning to leave at
once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; said the young man, &lsquo;I wish I
could; and indeed, as far as I am concerned, it might be
done.&nbsp; But then, my lodger!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your lodger?&rsquo; echoed Mrs. Luxmore.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lodger: why should I deny it?&rsquo; returned
Somerset.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is only by the week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old lady sat down upon a chair.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have a
lodger?&mdash;you?&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;And pray, how
did you get him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By advertisement,&rsquo; replied the young man.
&lsquo;O madam, I have not lived unobservantly.&nbsp; I
adopted&rsquo;&mdash;his eyes involuntarily shifted to the
cartoons&mdash;&lsquo;I adopted every method.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes had followed his; for the first time in
Somerset&rsquo;s experience, she produced a double eye-glass; and
as soon as the full merit of the works had flashed upon her, she
gave way to peal after peal of her trilling and soprano
laughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I think you are perfectly delicious!&rsquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do hope you had them in the window.&nbsp;
M&rsquo;Pherson,&rsquo; she continued, crying to her maid, who
had been all this time grimly waiting in the hall, &lsquo;I lunch
with Mr. Somerset.&nbsp; Take the cellar key and bring some
wine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this gay humour she continued throughout the luncheon;
presented Somerset with a couple of dozen of wine, which she made
M&rsquo;Pherson bring up from the cellar&mdash;&lsquo;as a
present, my dear,&rsquo; she said, with another burst of tearful
merriment, &lsquo;for your charming pictures, which you must be
sure to leave me when you go;&rsquo; and finally, protesting that
she dared not spoil the absurdest houseful of madmen in the whole
of London, departed (as she vaguely phrased it) for the continent
of Europe.</p>
<p>She was no sooner gone, than Somerset encountered in the
corridor the Irish nurse; sober, to all appearance, and yet a
prey to singularly strong emotion.&nbsp; It was made to appear,
from her account, that Mr. Jones had already suffered acutely in
his health from Mrs. Luxmore&rsquo;s visit, and that nothing
short of a full explanation could allay the invalid&rsquo;s
uneasiness.&nbsp; Somerset, somewhat staring, told what he
thought fit of the affair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; cried the woman.&nbsp; &lsquo;As
God sees you, is that all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My good woman,&rsquo; said the young man, &lsquo;I have
no idea what you can be driving at.&nbsp; Suppose the lady were
my friend&rsquo;s wife, suppose she were my fairy godmother,
suppose she were the Queen of Portugal; and how should that
affect yourself or Mr. Jones?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blessed Mary!&rsquo; cried the nurse, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
he that will be glad to hear it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And immediately she fled upstairs.</p>
<p>Somerset, on his part, returned to the dining-room, and with a
very thoughtful brow and ruminating many theories, disposed of
the remainder of the bottle.&nbsp; It was port; and port is a
wine, sole among its equals and superiors, that can in some
degree support the competition of tobacco.&nbsp; Sipping,
smoking, and theorising, Somerset moved on from suspicion to
suspicion, from resolve to resolve, still growing braver and
rosier as the bottle ebbed.&nbsp; He was a sceptic, none prouder
of the name; he had no horror at command, whether for crimes or
vices, but beheld and embraced the world, with an immoral
approbation, the frequent consequence of youth and health.&nbsp;
At the same time, he felt convinced that he dwelt under the same
roof with secret malefactors; and the unregenerate instinct of
the chase impelled him to severity.&nbsp; The bottle had run low;
the summer sun had finally withdrawn; and at the same moment,
night and the pangs of hunger recalled him from his dreams.</p>
<p>He went forth, and dined in the Criterion: a dinner in
consonance, not so much with his purse, as with the admirable
wine he had discussed.&nbsp; What with one thing and another, it
was long past midnight when he returned home.&nbsp; A cab was at
the door; and entering the hall, Somerset found himself face to
face with one of the most regular of the few who visited Mr.
Jones: a man of powerful figure, strong lineaments, and a
chin-beard in the American fashion.&nbsp; This person was
carrying on one shoulder a black portmanteau, seemingly of
considerable weight.&nbsp; That he should find a visitor removing
baggage in the dead of night, recalled some odd stories to the
young man&rsquo;s memory; he had heard of lodgers who thus
gradually drained away, not only their own effects, but the very
furniture and fittings of the house that sheltered them; and now,
in a mood between pleasantry and suspicion, and aping the manner
of a drunkard, he roughly bumped against the man with the
chin-beard and knocked the portmanteau from his shoulder to the
floor.&nbsp; With a face struck suddenly as white as paper, the
man with the chin-beard called lamentably on the name of his
maker, and fell in a mere heap on the mat at the foot of the
stairs.&nbsp; At the same time, though only for a single instant,
the heads of the sick lodger and the Irish nurse popped out like
rabbits over the banisters of the first floor; and on both the
same scare and pallor were apparent.</p>
<p>The sight of this incredible emotion turned Somerset to stone,
and he continued speechless, while the man gathered himself
together, and, with the help of the handrail and audibly thanking
God, scrambled once more upon his feet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What in Heaven&rsquo;s name ails you?&rsquo; gasped the
young man as soon as he could find words and utterance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you a drop of brandy?&rsquo; returned the
other.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am sick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somerset administered two drams, one after the other, to the
man with the chin-beard; who then, somewhat restored, began to
confound himself in apologies for what he called his miserable
nervousness, the result, he said, of a long course of dumb ague;
and having taken leave with a hand that still sweated and
trembled, he gingerly resumed his burthen and departed.</p>
<p>Somerset retired to bed but not to sleep.&nbsp; What, he asked
himself, had been the contents of the black portmanteau?&nbsp;
Stolen goods? the carcase of one murdered? or&mdash;and at the
thought he sat upright in bed&mdash;an infernal machine?&nbsp; He
took a solemn vow that he would set these doubts at rest; and
with the next morning, installed himself beside the dining-room
window, vigilant with eye; and ear, to await and profit by the
earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>The hours went heavily by.&nbsp; Within the house there was no
circumstance of novelty; unless it might be that the nurse more
frequently made little journeys round the corner of the square,
and before afternoon was somewhat loose of speech and gait.&nbsp;
A little after six, however, there came round the corner of the
gardens a very handsome and elegantly dressed young woman, who
paused a little way off, and for some time, and with frequent
sighs, contemplated the front of the Superfluous Mansion.&nbsp;
It was not the first time that she had thus stood afar and looked
upon it, like our common parents at the gates of Eden; and the
young man had already had occasion to remark the lively slimness
of her carriage, and had already been the butt of a chance arrow
from her eye.&nbsp; He hailed her coming, then, with pleasant
feelings, and moved a little nearer to the window to enjoy the
sight.&nbsp; What was his surprise, however, when, as if with a
sensible effort, she drew near, mounted the steps and tapped
discreetly at the door!&nbsp; He made haste to get before the
Irish nurse, who was not improbably asleep, and had the
satisfaction to receive this gracious visitor in person.</p>
<p>She inquired for Mr. Jones; and then, without transition,
asked the young man if he were the person of the house (and at
the words, he thought he could perceive her to be smiling),
&lsquo;because,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;if you are, I should
like to see some of the other rooms.&rsquo;&nbsp; Somerset told
her he was under an engagement to receive no other lodgers; but
she assured him that would be no matter, as these were friends of
Mr. Jones&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &lsquo;And,&rsquo; she continued, moving
suddenly to the dining-room door, &lsquo;let us begin
here.&rsquo;&nbsp; Somerset was too late to prevent her entering,
and perhaps he lacked the courage to essay.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;how changed it is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; cried the young man, &lsquo;since your
entrance, it is I who have the right to say so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She received this inane compliment with a demure and conscious
droop of the eyelids, and gracefully steering her dress among the
mingled litter, now with a smile, now with a sigh, reviewed the
wonders of the two apartments.&nbsp; She gazed upon the cartoons
with sparkling eyes, and a heightened colour, and in a somewhat
breathless voice, expressed a high opinion of their merits.&nbsp;
She praised the effective disposition of the rockery, and in the
bedroom, of which Somerset had vainly endeavoured to defend the
entry, she fairly broke forth in admiration.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
simple and manly!&rsquo; she cried: &lsquo;none of that
effeminacy of neatness, which is so detestable in a
man!&rsquo;&nbsp; Hard upon this, telling him, before he had time
to reply, that she very well knew her way, and would trouble him
no further, she took her leave with an engaging smile, and
ascended the staircase alone.</p>
<p>For more than an hour the young lady remained closeted with
Mr. Jones; and at the end of that time, the night being now come
completely, they left the house in company.&nbsp; This was the
first time since the arrival of his lodger, that Somerset had
found himself alone with the Irish widow; and without the loss of
any more time than was required by decency, he stepped to the
foot of the stairs and hailed her by her name.&nbsp; She came
instantly, wreathed in weak smiles and with a nodding head; and
when the young man politely offered to introduce her to the
treasures of his art, she swore that nothing could afford her
greater pleasure, for, though she had never crossed the
threshold, she had frequently observed his beautiful pictures
through the door.&nbsp; On entering the dining-room, the sight of
a bottle and two glasses prepared her to be a gentle critic; and
as soon as the pictures had been viewed and praised, she was
easily persuaded to join the painter in a single glass.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;are my respects; and a
pleasure it is, in this horrible house, to see a gentleman like
yourself, so affable and free, and a very nice painter, I am
sure.&rsquo;&nbsp; One glass so agreeably prefaced, was sure to
lead to the acceptance of a second; at the third, Somerset was
free to cease from the affectation of keeping her company; and as
for the fourth, she asked it of her own accord.&nbsp; &lsquo;For
indeed,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;what with all these clocks and
chemicals, without a drop of the creature life would be
impossible entirely.&nbsp; And you seen yourself that even
M&rsquo;Guire was glad to beg for it.&nbsp; And even himself,
when he is downhearted with all these cruel disappointments,
though as temperate a man as any child, will be sometimes crying
for a glass of it.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll thank you for a
thimbleful to settle what I got.&rsquo;&nbsp; Soon after, she
began with tears to narrate the deathbed dispositions and lament
the trifling assets of her husband.&nbsp; Then she declared she
heard &lsquo;the master&rsquo; calling her, rose to her feet,
made but one lurch of it into the still-life rockery, and with
her head upon the lobster, fell into stertorous slumbers.</p>
<p>Somerset mounted at once to the first story, and opened the
door of the drawing-room, which was brilliantly lit by several
lamps.&nbsp; It was a great apartment; looking on the square with
three tall windows, and joined by a pair of ample folding-doors
to the next room; elegant in proportion, papered in sea-green,
furnished in velvet of a delicate blue, and adorned with a
majestic mantelpiece of variously tinted marbles.&nbsp; Such was
the room that Somerset remembered; that which he now beheld was
changed in almost every feature: the furniture covered with a
figured chintz; the walls hung with a rhubarb-coloured paper, and
diversified by the curtained recesses for no less than seven
windows.&nbsp; It seemed to himself that he must have entered,
without observing the transition, into the adjoining house.&nbsp;
Presently from these more specious changes, his eye condescended
to the many curious objects with which the floor was
littered.&nbsp; Here were the locks of dismounted pistols; clocks
and clockwork in every stage of demolition, some still busily
ticking, some reduced to their dainty elements; a great company
of carboys, jars and bottles; a carpenter&rsquo;s bench and a
laboratory-table.</p>
<p>The back drawing-room, to which Somerset proceeded, had
likewise undergone a change.&nbsp; It was transformed to the
exact appearance of a common lodging-house bedroom; a bed with
green curtains occupied one corner; and the window was blocked by
the regulation table and mirror.&nbsp; The door of a small closet
here attracted the young man&rsquo;s attention; and striking a
vesta, he opened it and entered.&nbsp; On a table several wigs
and beards were lying spread; about the walls hung an incongruous
display of suits and overcoats; and conspicuous among the last
the young man observed a large overall of the most costly
sealskin.&nbsp; In a flash his mind reverted to the advertisement
in the <i>Standard</i> newspaper.&nbsp; The great height of his
lodger, the disproportionate breadth of his shoulders, and the
strange particulars of his instalment, all pointed to the same
conclusion.</p>
<p>The vesta had now burned to his fingers; and taking the coat
upon his arm, Somerset hastily returned to the lighted
drawing-room.&nbsp; There, with a mixture of fear and admiration,
he pored upon its goodly proportions and the regularity and
softness of the pile.&nbsp; The sight of a large pier-glass put
another fancy in his head.&nbsp; He donned the fur-coat; and
standing before the mirror in an attitude suggestive of a Russian
prince, he thrust his hands into the ample pockets.&nbsp; There
his fingers encountered a folded journal.&nbsp; He drew it out,
and recognised the type and paper of the <i>Standard</i>; and at
the same instant, his eyes alighted on the offer of two hundred
pounds.&nbsp; Plainly then, his lodger, now no longer mysterious,
had laid aside his coat on the very day of the appearance of the
advertisement.</p>
<p>He was thus standing, the tell-tale coat upon his back, the
incriminating paper in his hand, when the door opened and the
tall lodger, with a firm but somewhat pallid face, stepped into
the room and closed the door again behind him.&nbsp; For some
time, the two looked upon each other in perfect silence; then Mr.
Jones moved forward to the table, took a seat, and still without
once changing the direction of his eyes, addressed the young
man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are right,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is for
me the blood money is offered.&nbsp; And now what will you
do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a question to which Somerset was far from being able to
reply.&nbsp; Taken as he was at unawares, masquerading in the
man&rsquo;s own coat, and surrounded by a whole arsenal of
diabolical explosives, the keeper of the lodging-house was
silenced.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; resumed the other, &lsquo;I am he.&nbsp; I
am that man, whom with impotent hate and fear, they still hunt
from den to den, from disguise to disguise.&nbsp; Yes, my
landlord, you have it in your power, if you be poor, to lay the
basis of your fortune; if you be unknown, to capture honour at
one snatch.&nbsp; You have hocussed an innocent widow; and I find
you here in my apartment, for whose use I pay you in stamped
money, searching my wardrobe, and your hand&mdash;shame,
sir!&mdash;your hand in my very pocket.&nbsp; You can now
complete the cycle of your ignominious acts, by what will be at
once the simplest, the safest, and the most
remunerative.&rsquo;&nbsp; The speaker paused as if to emphasise
his words; and then, with a great change of tone and manner, thus
resumed: &lsquo;And yet, sir, when I look upon your face, I feel
certain that I cannot be deceived: certain that in spite of all,
I have the honour and pleasure of speaking to a gentleman.&nbsp;
Take off my coat, sir&mdash;which but cumbers you.&nbsp; Divest
yourself of this confusion: that which is but thought upon, thank
God, need be no burthen to the conscience; we have all harboured
guilty thoughts: and if it flashed into your mind to sell my
flesh and blood, my anguish in the dock, and the sweat of my
death agony&mdash;it was a thought, dear sir, you were as
incapable of acting on, as I of any further question of your
honour.&rsquo;&nbsp; At these words, the speaker, with a very
open, smiling countenance, like a forgiving father, offered
Somerset his hand.</p>
<p>It was not in the young man&rsquo;s nature to refuse
forgiveness or dissect generosity.&nbsp; He instantly, and almost
without thought, accepted the proffered grasp.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; resumed the lodger, &lsquo;now that I
hold in mine your loyal hand, I lay by my apprehensions, I
dismiss suspicion, I go further&mdash;by an effort of will, I
banish the memory of what is past.&nbsp; How you came here, I
care not: enough that you are here&mdash;as my guest.&nbsp; Sit
ye down; and let us, with your good permission, improve
acquaintance over a glass of excellent whisky.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So speaking, he produced glasses and a bottle: and the pair
pledged each other in silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Confess,&rsquo; observed the smiling host, &lsquo;you
were surprised at the appearance of the room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was indeed,&rsquo; said Somerset; &lsquo;nor can I
imagine the purpose of these changes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;These,&rsquo; replied the conspirator, &lsquo;are the
devices by which I continue to exist.&nbsp; Conceive me now,
accused before one of your unjust tribunals; conceive the various
witnesses appearing, and the singular variety of their
reports!&nbsp; One will have visited me in this drawing-room as
it originally stood; a second finds it as it is to-night; and
to-morrow or next day, all may have been changed.&nbsp; If you
love romance (as artists do), few lives are more romantic than
that of the obscure individual now addressing you.&nbsp; Obscure
yet famous.&nbsp; Mine is an anonymous, infernal glory.&nbsp; By
infamous means, I work towards my bright purpose.&nbsp; I found
the liberty and peace of a poor country, desperately abused; the
future smiles upon that land; yet, in the meantime, I lead the
existence of a hunted brute, work towards appalling ends, and
practice hell&rsquo;s dexterities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somerset, glass in hand, contemplated the strange fanatic
before him, and listened to his heated rhapsody, with
indescribable bewilderment.&nbsp; He looked him in the face with
curious particularity; saw there the marks of education; and
wondered the more profoundly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; he said&mdash;&lsquo;for I know not whether
I should still address you as Mr. Jones&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jones, Breitman, Higginbotham, Pumpernickel, Daviot,
Henderland, by all or any of these you may address me,&rsquo;
said the plotter; &lsquo;for all I have at some time borne.&nbsp;
Yet that which I most prize, that which is most feared, hated,
and obeyed, is not a name to be found in your directories; it is
not a name current in post-offices or banks; and, indeed, like
the celebrated clan M&rsquo;Gregor, I may justly describe myself
as being nameless by day.&nbsp; But,&rsquo; he continued, rising
to his feet, &lsquo;by night, and among my desperate followers, I
am the redoubted Zero.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somerset was unacquainted with the name, but he politely
expressed surprise and gratification.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am to
understand,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;that, under this alias,
you follow the profession of a dynamiter?&rsquo; <a
name="citation176"></a><a href="#footnote176"
class="citation">[176]</a></p>
<p>The plotter had resumed his seat and now replenished the
glasses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;In this dark period
of time, a star&mdash;the star of dynamite&mdash;has risen for
the oppressed; and among those who practise its use, so thick
beset with dangers and attended by such incredible difficulties
and disappointments, few have been more assiduous, and not
many&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; He paused, and a shade of embarrassment
appeared upon his face&mdash;&lsquo;not many have been more
successful than myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can imagine,&rsquo; observed Somerset, &lsquo;that,
from the sweeping consequences looked for, the career is not
devoid of interest.&nbsp; You have, besides, some of the
entertainment of the game of hide and seek.&nbsp; But it would
still seem to me&mdash;I speak as a layman&mdash;that nothing
could be simpler or safer than to deposit an infernal machine and
retire to an adjacent county to await the painful
consequences.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You speak, indeed,&rsquo; returned the plotter, with
some evidence of warmth, &lsquo;you speak, indeed, most
ignorantly.&nbsp; Do you make nothing, then, of such a peril as
we share this moment?&nbsp; Do you think it nothing to occupy a
house like this one, mined, menaced, and, in a word, literally
tottering to its fall?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good God!&rsquo; ejaculated Somerset.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And when you speak of ease,&rsquo; pursued Zero,
&lsquo;in this age of scientific studies, you fill me with
surprise.&nbsp; Are you not aware that chemicals are proverbially
fickle as woman, and clockwork as capricious as the very
devil?&nbsp; Do you see upon my brow these furrows of
anxiety?&nbsp; Do you observe the silver threads that mingle with
my hair?&nbsp; Clockwork, clockwork has stamped them on my
brow&mdash;chemicals have sprinkled them upon my locks!&nbsp; No,
Mr. Somerset,&rsquo; he resumed, after a moment&rsquo;s pause,
his voice still quivering with sensibility, &lsquo;you must not
suppose the dynamiter&rsquo;s life to be all gold.&nbsp; On the
contrary, you cannot picture to yourself the bloodshot vigils and
the staggering disappointments of a life like mine.&nbsp; I have
toiled (let us say) for months, up early and down late; my bag is
ready, my clock set; a daring agent has hurried with white face
to deposit the instrument of ruin; we await the fall of England,
the massacre of thousands, the yell of fear and execration; and
lo! a snap like that of a child&rsquo;s pistol, an offensive
smell, and the entire loss of so much time and plant!&nbsp;
If,&rsquo; he concluded, musingly, &lsquo;we had been merely able
to recover the lost bags, I believe with but a touch or two, I
could have remedied the peccant engine.&nbsp; But what with the
loss of plant and the almost insuperable scientific difficulties
of the task, our friends in France are almost ready to desert the
chosen medium.&nbsp; They propose, instead, to break up the
drainage system of cities and sweep off whole populations with
the devastating typhoid pestilence: a tempting and a scientific
project: a process, indiscriminate indeed, but of idyllical
simplicity.&nbsp; I recognise its elegance; but, sir, I have
something of the poet in my nature; something, possibly, of the
tribune.&nbsp; And, for my small part, I shall remain devoted to
that more emphatic, more striking, and (if you please) more
popular method, of the explosive bomb.&nbsp; Yes,&rsquo; he
cried, with unshaken hope, &lsquo;I will still continue, and, I
feel it in my bosom, I shall yet succeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two things I remark,&rsquo; said Somerset.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The first somewhat staggers me.&nbsp; Have you,
then&mdash;in all this course of life, which you have sketched so
vividly&mdash;have you not once succeeded?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo; said Zero.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have had
one success.&nbsp; You behold in me the author of the outrage of
Red Lion Court.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But if I remember right,&rsquo; objected Somerset,
&lsquo;the thing was a <i>fiasco</i>.&nbsp; A scavenger&rsquo;s
barrow and some copies of the <i>Weekly Budget</i>&mdash;these
were the only victims.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will pardon me again,&rsquo; returned Zero with
positive asperity: &lsquo;a child was injured.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that fitly brings me to my second point,&rsquo;
said Somerset.&nbsp; &lsquo;For I observed you to employ the word
&ldquo;indiscriminate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, surely, a
scavenger&rsquo;s barrow and a child (if child there were)
represent the very acme and top pin-point of indiscriminate, and,
pardon me, of ineffectual reprisal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I employ the word?&rsquo; asked Zero.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, I will not defend it.&nbsp; But for efficiency, you
touch on graver matters; and before entering upon so vast a
subject, permit me once more to fill our glasses.&nbsp;
Disputation is dry work,&rsquo; he added, with a charming gaiety
of manner.</p>
<p>Once more accordingly the pair pledged each other in a
stalwart grog; and Zero, leaning back with an air of some
complacency, proceeded more largely to develop his opinions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The indiscriminate?&rsquo; he began.&nbsp; &lsquo;War,
my dear sir, is indiscriminate.&nbsp; War spares not the child;
it spares not the barrow of the harmless scavenger.&nbsp; No
more,&rsquo; he concluded, beaming, &lsquo;no more do I.&nbsp;
Whatever may strike fear, whatever may confound or paralyse the
activities of the guilty nation, barrow or child, imperial
Parliament or excursion steamer, is welcome to my simple
plans.&nbsp; You are not,&rsquo; he inquired, with a shade of
sympathetic interest, &lsquo;you are not, I trust, a
believer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, I believe in nothing,&rsquo; said the young
man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are then,&rsquo; replied Zero, &lsquo;in a position
to grasp my argument.&nbsp; We agree that humanity is the object,
the glorious triumph of humanity; and being pledged to labour for
that end, and face to face with the banded opposition of kings,
parliaments, churches, and the members of the force, who am
I&mdash;who are we, dear sir&mdash;to affect a nicety about the
tools employed?&nbsp; You might, perhaps, expect us to attack the
Queen, the sinister Gladstone, the rigid Derby, or the dexterous
Granville; but there you would be in error.&nbsp; Our appeal is
to the body of the people; it is these that we would touch and
interest.&nbsp; Now, sir, have you observed the English
housemaid?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think I had,&rsquo; cried Somerset.</p>
<p>&lsquo;From a man of taste and a votary of art, I had expected
it,&rsquo; returned the conspirator politely.&nbsp; &lsquo;A type
apart; a very charming figure; and thoroughly adapted to our
ends.&nbsp; The neat cap, the clean print, the comely person, the
engaging manner; her position between classes, parents in one,
employers in another; the probability that she will have at least
one sweet-heart, whose feelings we shall address:&mdash;yes, I
have a leaning&mdash;call it, if you will, a weakness&mdash;for
the housemaid.&nbsp; Not that I would be understood to despise
the nurse.&nbsp; For the child is a very interesting feature: I
have long since marked out the child as the sensitive point in
society.&rsquo;&nbsp; He wagged his head, with a wise, pensive
smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;And talking, sir, of children and of the
perils of our trade, let me now narrate to you a little incident
of an explosive bomb, that fell out some weeks ago under my own
observation.&nbsp; It fell out thus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Zero, leaning back in his chair, narrated the following
simple tale.</p>
<h3><!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span><i>ZERO&rsquo;S TALE OF THE
EXPLOSIVE BOMB</i>. <a name="citation182"></a><a
href="#footnote182" class="citation">[182]</a></h3>
<p>I dined by appointment with one of our most trusted agents, in
a private chamber at St. James&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; You have seen
the man: it was M&rsquo;Guire, the most chivalrous of creatures,
but not himself expert in our contrivances.&nbsp; Hence the
necessity of our meeting; for I need not remind you what enormous
issues depend upon the nice adjustment of the engine.&nbsp; I set
our little petard for half an hour, the scene of action being
hard by; and the better to avert miscarriage, employed a device,
a recent invention of my own, by which the opening of the
Gladstone bag in which the bomb was carried, should instantly
determine the explosion.&nbsp; M&rsquo;Guire was somewhat dashed
by this arrangement, which was new to him: and pointed out, with
excellent, clear good sense, that should he be arrested, it would
probably involve him in the fall of our opponents.&nbsp; But I
was not to be moved, made a strong appeal to his patriotism, gave
him a good glass of whisky, and despatched him on his glorious
errand.</p>
<p>Our objective was the effigy of Shakespeare in Leicester
Square: a spot, I think, admirably chosen; not only for the sake
of the dramatist, still very foolishly claimed as a glory by the
English race, in spite of his disgusting political opinions; but
from the fact that the seats in the immediate neighbourhood are
often thronged by children, errand-boys, unfortunate young ladies
of the poorer class and infirm old men&mdash;all classes making a
direct appeal to public pity, and therefore suitable with our
designs.&nbsp; As M&rsquo;Guire drew near his heart was inflamed
by the most noble sentiment of triumph.&nbsp; Never had he seen
the garden so crowded; children, still stumbling in the impotence
of youth, ran to and fro, shouting and playing, round the
pedestal; an old, sick pensioner sat upon the nearest bench, a
medal on his breast, a stick with which he walked (for he was
disabled by wounds) reclining on his knee.&nbsp; Guilty England
would thus be stabbed in the most delicate quarters; the moment
had, indeed, been well selected; and M&rsquo;Guire, with a
radiant provision of the event, drew merrily nearer.&nbsp;
Suddenly his eye alighted on the burly form of a policeman,
standing hard by the effigy in an attitude of watch.&nbsp; My
bold companion paused; he looked about him closely; here and
there, at different points of the enclosure, other men stood or
loitered, affecting an abstraction, feigning to gaze upon the
shrubs, feigning to talk, feigning to be weary and to rest upon
the benches.&nbsp; M&rsquo;Guire was no child in these affairs;
he instantly divined one of the plots of the Machiavellian
Gladstone.</p>
<p>A chief difficulty with which we have to deal, is a certain
nervousness in the subaltern branches of the corps; as the hour
of some design draws near, these chicken-souled conspirators
appear to suffer some revulsion of intent; and frequently
despatch to the authorities, not indeed specific denunciations,
but vague anonymous warnings.&nbsp; But for this purely
accidental circumstance, England had long ago been an historical
expression.&nbsp; On the receipt of such a letter, the Government
lay a trap for their adversaries, and surround the threatened
spot with hirelings.&nbsp; My blood sometimes boils in my veins,
when I consider the case of those who sell themselves for money
in such a cause.&nbsp; True, thanks to the generosity of our
supporters, we patriots receive a very comfortable stipend; I
myself, of course, touch a salary which puts me quite beyond the
reach of any peddling, mercenary thoughts; M&rsquo;Guire, again,
ere he joined our ranks, was on the brink of starving, and now,
thank God! receives a decent income.&nbsp; That is as it should
be; the patriot must not be diverted from his task by any base
consideration; and the distinction between our position and that
of the police is too obvious to be stated.</p>
<p>Plainly, however, our Leicester Square design had been
divulged; the Government had craftily filled the place with
minions; even the pensioner was not improbably a hireling in
disguise; and our emissary, without other aid or protection than
the simple apparatus in his bag, found himself confronted by
force; brutal force; that strong hand which was a character of
the ages of oppression.&nbsp; Should he venture to deposit the
machine, it was almost certain that he would be observed and
arrested; a cry would arise; and there was just a fear that the
police might not be present in sufficient force, to protect him
from the savagery of the mob.&nbsp; The scheme must be
delayed.&nbsp; He stood with his bag on his arm, pretending to
survey the front of the Alhambra, when there flashed into his
mind a thought to appal the bravest.&nbsp; The machine was set;
at the appointed hour, it must explode; and how, in the interval,
was he to be rid of it?</p>
<p>Put yourself, I beseech you, into the body of that
patriot.&nbsp; There he was, friendless and helpless; a man in
the very flower of life, for he is not yet forty; with long years
of happiness before him; and now condemned, in one moment, to a
cruel and revolting death by dynamite!&nbsp; The square, he said,
went round him like a thaumatrope; he saw the Alhambra leap into
the air like a balloon; and reeled against the railing.&nbsp; It
is probable he fainted.</p>
<p>When he came to himself, a constable had him by the arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My God!&rsquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem to be unwell, sir,&rsquo; said the
hireling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I feel better now,&rsquo; cried poor M&rsquo;Guire: and
with uneven steps, for the pavement of the square seemed to lurch
and reel under his footing, he fled from the scene of this
disaster.&nbsp; Fled?&nbsp; Alas, from what was he fleeing?&nbsp;
Did he not carry that from which he fled along with him? and had
he the wings of the eagle, had he the swiftness of the ocean
winds, could he have been rapt into the uttermost quarters of the
earth, how should he escape the ruin that he carried?&nbsp; We
have heard of living men who have been fettered to the dead; the
grievance, soberly considered, is no more than sentimental; the
case is but a flea-bite to that of him who should be linked, like
poor M&rsquo;Guire, to an explosive bomb.</p>
<p>A thought struck him in Green Street, like a dart through his
liver: suppose it were the hour already.&nbsp; He stopped as
though he had been shot, and plucked his watch out.&nbsp; There
was a howling in his ears, as loud as a winter tempest; his sight
was now obscured as if by a cloud, now, as by a lightning flash,
would show him the very dust upon the street.&nbsp; But so brief
were these intervals of vision, and so violently did the watch
vibrate in his hands, that it was impossible to distinguish the
numbers on the dial.&nbsp; He covered his eyes for a few seconds;
and in that space, it seemed to him that he had fallen to be a
man of ninety.&nbsp; When he looked again, the watch-plate had
grown legible: he had twenty minutes.&nbsp; Twenty minutes, and
no plan!</p>
<p>Green Street, at that time, was very empty; and he now
observed a little girl of about six drawing near to him, and as
she came, kicking in front of her, as children will, a piece of
wood.&nbsp; She sang, too; and something in her accent recalling
him to the past, produced a sudden clearness in his mind.&nbsp;
Here was a God-sent opportunity!</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;would you like a
present of a pretty bag?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The child cried aloud with joy and put out her hands to take
it.&nbsp; She had looked first at the bag, like a true child; but
most unfortunately, before she had yet received the fatal gift,
her eyes fell directly on M&rsquo;Guire; and no sooner had she
seen the poor gentleman&rsquo;s face, than she screamed out and
leaped backward, as though she had seen the devil.&nbsp; Almost
at the same moment a woman appeared upon the threshold of a
neighbouring shop, and called upon the child in anger.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come here, colleen,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and
don&rsquo;t be plaguing the poor old gentleman!&rsquo;&nbsp; With
that she re-entered the house, and the child followed her,
sobbing aloud.</p>
<p>With the loss of this hope M&rsquo;Guire&rsquo;s reason
swooned within him.&nbsp; When next he awoke to consciousness, he
was standing before St. Martin&rsquo;s-in-the-Fields, wavering
like a drunken man; the passers-by regarding him with eyes in
which he read, as in a glass, an image of the terror and horror
that dwelt within his own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid you are very ill, sir,&rsquo; observed a
woman, stopping and gazing hard in his face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can I
do anything to help you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ill?&rsquo; said M&rsquo;Guire.&nbsp; &lsquo;O
God!&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, recovering some shadow of his
self-command, &lsquo;Chronic, madam,&rsquo; said he: &lsquo;a
long course of the dumb ague.&nbsp; But since you are so
compassionate&mdash;an errand that I lack the strength to carry
out,&rsquo; he gasped&mdash;&lsquo;this bag to Portman
Square.&nbsp; Oh, compassionate woman, as you hope to be saved,
as you are a mother, in the name of your babes that wait to
welcome you at home, oh, take this bag to Portman Square!&nbsp; I
have a mother, too,&rsquo; he added, with a broken voice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Number 19, Portman Square.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I suppose he had expressed himself with too much energy of
voice; for the woman was plainly taken with a certain fear of
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor gentleman!&rsquo; said she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If I were you, I would go home.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she left
him standing there in his distress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Home!&rsquo; thought M&rsquo;Guire, &lsquo;what a
derision!&rsquo;&nbsp; What home was there for him, the victim of
philanthropy?&nbsp; He thought of his old mother, of his happy
youth; of the hideous, rending pang of the explosion; of the
possibility that he might not be killed, that he might be cruelly
mangled, crippled for life, condemned to lifelong pains, blinded
perhaps, and almost surely deafened.&nbsp; Ah, you spoke lightly
of the dynamiter&rsquo;s peril; but even waiving death, have you
realised what it is for a fine, brave young man of forty, to be
smitten suddenly with deafness, cut off from all the music of
life, and from the voice of friendship, and love?&nbsp; How
little do we realise the sufferings of others!&nbsp; Even your
brutal Government, in the heyday of its lust for cruelty, though
it scruples not to hound the patriot with spies, to pack the
corrupt jury, to bribe the hangman, and to erect the infamous
gallows, would hesitate to inflict so horrible a doom: not, I am
well aware, from virtue, not from philanthropy, but with the fear
before it of the withering scorn of the good.</p>
<p>But I wander from M&rsquo;Guire.&nbsp; From this dread glance
into the past and future, his thoughts returned at a bound upon
the present.&nbsp; How had he wandered there? and how
long&mdash;oh, heavens! how long had he been about it?&nbsp; He
pulled out his watch; and found that but three minutes had
elapsed.&nbsp; It seemed too bright a thing to be believed.&nbsp;
He glanced at the church clock; and sure enough, it marked an
hour four minutes faster than the watch.</p>
<p>Of all that he endured, M&rsquo;Guire declares that pang was
the most desolate.&nbsp; Till then, he had had one friend, one
counsellor, in whom he plenarily trusted; by whose advertisement,
he numbered the minutes that remained to him of life; on whose
sure testimony, he could tell when the time was come to risk the
last adventure, to cast the bag away from him, and take to
flight.&nbsp; And now in what was he to place reliance?&nbsp; His
watch was slow; it might be losing time; if so, in what
degree?&nbsp; What limit could he set to its derangement? and how
much was it possible for a watch to lose in thirty minutes?&nbsp;
Five? ten? fifteen?&nbsp; It might be so; already, it seemed
years since he had left St. James&rsquo;s Hall on this so
promising enterprise; at any moment, then, the blow was to be
looked for.</p>
<p>In the face of this new distress, the wild disorder of his
pulses settled down; and a broken weariness succeeded, as though
he had lived for centuries and for centuries been dead.&nbsp; The
buildings and the people in the street became incredibly small,
and far-away, and bright; London sounded in his ears stilly, like
a whisper; and the rattle of the cab that nearly charged him
down, was like a sound from Africa.&nbsp; Meanwhile, he was
conscious of a strange abstraction from himself; and heard and
felt his footfalls on the ground, as those of a very old, small,
debile and tragically fortuned man, whom he sincerely pitied.</p>
<p>As he was thus moving forward past the National Gallery, in a
medium, it seemed, of greater rarity and quiet than ordinary air,
there slipped into his mind the recollection of a certain entry
in Whitcomb Street hard by, where he might perhaps lay down his
tragic cargo unremarked.&nbsp; Thither, then, he bent his steps,
seeming, as he went, to float above the pavement; and there, in
the mouth of the entry, he found a man in a sleeved waistcoat,
gravely chewing a straw.&nbsp; He passed him by, and twice
patrolled the entry, scouting for the barest chance; but the man
had faced about and continued to observe him curiously.</p>
<p>Another hope was gone.&nbsp; M&rsquo;Guire reissued from the
entry, still followed by the wondering eyes of the man in the
sleeved waistcoat.&nbsp; He once more consulted his watch: there
were but fourteen minutes left to him.&nbsp; At that, it seemed
as if a sudden, genial heat were spread about his brain; for a
second or two, he saw the world as red as blood; and thereafter
entered into a complete possession of himself, with an incredible
cheerfulness of spirits, prompting him to sing and chuckle as he
walked.&nbsp; And yet this mirth seemed to belong to things
external; and within, like a black and leaden-heavy kernel, he
was conscious of the weight upon his soul.</p>
<blockquote><p>I care for nobody, no, not I,<br />
And nobody cares for me,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he sang, and laughed at the appropriate burthen, so that the
passengers stared upon him on the street.&nbsp; And still the
warmth seemed to increase and to become more genial.&nbsp; What
was life? he considered, and what he, M&rsquo;Guire?&nbsp; What
even Erin, our green Erin?&nbsp; All seemed so incalculably
little that he smiled as he looked down upon it.&nbsp; He would
have given years, had he possessed them, for a glass of spirits;
but time failed, and he must deny himself this last
indulgence.</p>
<p>At the corner of the Haymarket, he very jauntily hailed a
hansom cab; jumped in; bade the fellow drive him to a part of the
Embankment, which he named; and as soon as the vehicle was in
motion, concealed the bag as completely as he could under the
vantage of the apron, and once more drew out his watch.&nbsp; So
he rode for five interminable minutes, his heart in his mouth at
every jolt, scarce able to possess his terrors, yet fearing to
wake the attention of the driver by too obvious a change of plan,
and willing, if possible, to leave him time to forget the
Gladstone bag.</p>
<p>At length, at the head of some stairs on the Embankment, he
hailed; the cab was stopped; and he alighted&mdash;with how glad
a heart!&nbsp; He thrust his hand into his pocket.&nbsp; All was
now over; he had saved his life; nor that alone, but he had
engineered a striking act of dynamite; for what could be more
pictorial, what more effective, than the explosion of a hansom
cab, as it sped rapidly along the streets of London.&nbsp; He
felt in one pocket; then in another.&nbsp; The most crushing
seizure of despair descended on his soul; and struck into abject
dumbness, he stared upon the driver.&nbsp; He had not one
penny.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hillo,&rsquo; said the driver, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t seem
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lost my money,&rsquo; said M&rsquo;Guire, in tones so
faint and strange that they surprised his hearing.</p>
<p>The man looked through the trap.&nbsp; &lsquo;I dessay,&rsquo;
said he: &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve left your bag.&rsquo;</p>
<p>M&rsquo;Guire half unconsciously fetched it out; and looking
on that black continent at arm&rsquo;s length, withered inwardly
and felt his features sharpen as with mortal sickness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is not mine,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your
last fare must have left it.&nbsp; You had better take it to the
station.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now look here,&rsquo; returned the cabman: &lsquo;are
you off your chump? or am I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rsquo; exclaimed
M&rsquo;Guire; &lsquo;you take it for your fare!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I dessay,&rsquo; replied the driver.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Anything else?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s <i>in</i> your
bag?&nbsp; Open it, and let me see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; returned M&rsquo;Guire.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh
no, not that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a surprise; it&rsquo;s prepared
expressly: a surprise for honest cabmen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the man, alighting
from his perch, and coming very close to the unhappy
patriot.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re either going to pay my fare,
or get in again and drive to the office.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was at this supreme hour of his distress, that
M&rsquo;Guire spied the stout figure of one Godall, a tobacconist
of Rupert Street, drawing near along the Embankment.&nbsp; The
man was not unknown to him; he had bought of his wares, and heard
him quoted for the soul of liberality; and such was now the
nearness of his peril, that even at such a straw of hope, he
clutched with gratitude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank God!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here comes a
friend of mine.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll borrow.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he
dashed to meet the tradesman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;Mr. Godall, I have dealt with you&mdash;you doubtless know
my face&mdash;calamities for which I cannot blame myself have
overwhelmed me.&nbsp; Oh, sir, for the love of innocence, for the
sake of the bonds of humanity, and as you hope for mercy at the
throne of grace, lend me two-and-six!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not recognise your face,&rsquo; replied Mr.
Godall; &lsquo;but I remember the cut of your beard, which I have
the misfortune to dislike.&nbsp; Here, sir, is a sovereign; which
I very willingly advance to you, on the single condition that you
shave your chin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>M&rsquo;Guire grasped the coin without a word; cast it to the
cabman, calling out to him to keep the change; bounded down the
steps, flung the bag far forth into the river, and fell headlong
after it.&nbsp; He was plucked from a watery grave, it is
believed, by the hands of Mr. Godall.&nbsp; Even as he was being
hoisted dripping to the shore, a dull and choked explosion shook
the solid masonry of the Embankment, and far out in the river a
momentary fountain rose and disappeared.</p>

(<i>Continued</i>)</h2>
<p>Somerset in vain strove to attach a meaning to these
words.&nbsp; He had, in the meanwhile, applied himself
assiduously to the flagon; the plotter began to melt in twain,
and seemed to expand and hover on his seat; and with a vague
sense of nightmare, the young man rose unsteadily to his feet,
and, refusing the proffer of a third grog, insisted that the hour
was late and he must positively get to bed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; observed Zero, &lsquo;I find you very
temperate.&nbsp; But I will not be oppressive.&nbsp; Suffice it
that we are now fast friends; and, my dear landlord, <i>au
revoir</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So saying the plotter once more shook hands; and with the
politest ceremonies, and some necessary guidance, conducted the
bewildered young gentleman to the top of the stair.</p>
<p>Precisely, how he got to bed, was a point on which Somerset
remained in utter darkness; but the next morning when, at a blow,
he started broad awake, there fell upon his mind a perfect
hurricane of horror and wonder.&nbsp; That he should have
suffered himself to be led into the semblance of intimacy with
such a man as his abominable lodger, appeared, in the cold light
of day, a mystery of human weakness.&nbsp; True, he was caught in
a situation that might have tested the aplomb of
Talleyrand.&nbsp; That was perhaps a palliation; but it was no
excuse.&nbsp; For so wholesale a capitulation of principle, for
such a fall into criminal familiarity, no excuse indeed was
possible; nor any remedy, but to withdraw at once from the
relation.</p>
<p>As soon as he was dressed, he hurried upstairs, determined on
a rupture.&nbsp; Zero hailed him with the warmth of an old
friend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;dear Mr.
Somerset!&nbsp; Come in, sit down, and, without ceremony, join me
at my morning meal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Somerset, &lsquo;you must permit me
first to disengage my honour.&nbsp; Last night, I was surprised
into a certain appearance of complicity; but once for all, let me
inform you that I regard you and your machinations \with
unmingled horror and disgust, and I will leave no stone unturned
to crush your vile conspiracy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear fellow,&rsquo; replied Zero, with an air of
some complacency, &lsquo;I am well accustomed to these human
weaknesses.&nbsp; Disgust?&nbsp; I have felt it myself; it
speedily wears off.&nbsp; I think none the worse, I think the
more of you, for this engaging frankness.&nbsp; And in the
meanwhile, what are you to do?&nbsp; You find yourself, if I
interpret rightly, in very much the same situation as Charles the
Second (possibly the least degraded of your British sovereigns)
when he was taken into the confidence of the thief.&nbsp; To
denounce me, is out of the question; and what else can you
attempt?&nbsp; No, dear Mr. Somerset, your hands are tied; and
you find yourself condemned, under pain of behaving like a cad,
to be that same charming and intellectual companion who delighted
me last night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At least,&rsquo; cried Somerset, &lsquo;I can, and do,
order you to leave this house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried the plotter, &lsquo;but there I fail
to follow you.&nbsp; You may, if you please, enact the part of
Judas; but if, as I suppose, you recoil from that extremity of
meanness, I am, on my side, far too intelligent to leave these
lodgings, in which I please myself exceedingly, and from which
you lack the power to drive me.&nbsp; No, no, dear sir; here I
am, and here I propose to stay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I repeat,&rsquo; cried Somerset, beside himself with a
sense of his own weakness, &lsquo;I repeat that I give you
warning.&nbsp; I am the master of this house; and I emphatically
give you warning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A week&rsquo;s warning?&rsquo; said the imperturbable
conspirator.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very well: we will talk of it a week
from now.&nbsp; That is arranged; and in the meanwhile, I observe
my breakfast growing cold.&nbsp; Do, dear Mr. Somerset, since you
find yourself condemned, for a week at least, to the society of a
very interesting character, display some of that open favour,
some of that interest in life&rsquo;s obscurer sides, which stamp
the character of the true artist.&nbsp; Hang me, if you will,
to-morrow; but to-day show yourself divested of the scruples of
the burgess, and sit down pleasantly to share my meal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Man!&rsquo; cried Somerset, &lsquo;do you understand my
sentiments?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; replied Zero; &lsquo;and I respect
them!&nbsp; Would you be outdone in such a contest? will you
alone be partial? and in this nineteenth century, cannot two
gentlemen of education agree to differ on a point of
politics?&nbsp; Come, sir: all your hard words have left me
smiling; judge then, which of us is the philosopher!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somerset was a young man of a very tolerant disposition and by
nature easily amenable to sophistry.&nbsp; He threw up his hands
with a gesture of despair, and took the seat to which the
conspirator invited him.&nbsp; The meal was excellent; the host
not only affable, but primed with curious information.&nbsp; He
seemed, indeed, like one who had too long endured the torture of
silence, to exult in the most wholesale disclosures.&nbsp; The
interest of what he had to tell was great; his character,
besides, developed step by step; and Somerset, as the time fled,
not only outgrew some of the discomfort of his false position,
but began to regard the conspirator with a familiarity that
verged upon contempt.&nbsp; In any circumstances, he had a
singular inability to leave the society in which he found
himself; company, even if distasteful, held him captive like a
limed sparrow; and on this occasion, he suffered hour to follow
hour, was easily persuaded to sit down once more to table, and
did not even attempt to withdraw till, on the approach of
evening, Zero, with many apologies, dismissed his guest.&nbsp;
His fellow-conspirators, the dynamiter handsomely explained, as
they were unacquainted with the sterling qualities of the young
man, would be alarmed at the sight of a strange face.</p>
<p>As soon as he was alone, Somerset fell back upon the humour of
the morning.&nbsp; He raged at the thought of his facility; he
paced the dining-room, forming the sternest resolutions for the
future; he wrung the hand which had been dishonoured by the touch
of an assassin; and among all these whirling thoughts, there
flashed in from time to time, and ever with a chill of fear, the
thought of the confounded ingredients with which the house was
stored.&nbsp; A powder magazine seemed a secure smoking-room
alongside of the Superfluous Mansion.</p>
<p>He sought refuge in flight, in locomotion, in the flowing
bowl.&nbsp; As long as the bars were open, he travelled from one
to another, seeking light, safety, and the companionship of human
faces; when these resources failed him, he fell back on the
belated baked-potato man; and at length, still pacing the
streets, he was goaded to fraternise with the police.&nbsp; Alas,
with what a sense of guilt he conversed with these guardians of
the law; how gladly had he wept upon their ample bosoms; and how
the secret fluttered to his lips and was still denied an
exit!&nbsp; Fatigue began at last to triumph over remorse; and
about the hour of the first milkman, he returned to the door of
the mansion; looked at it with a horrid expectation, as though it
should have burst that instant into flames; drew out his key, and
when his foot already rested on the steps, once more lost heart
and fled for repose to the grisly shelter of a coffee-shop.</p>
<p>It was on the stroke of noon when he awoke.&nbsp; Dismally
searching in his pockets, he found himself reduced to
half-a-crown; and when he had paid the price of his distasteful
couch, saw himself obliged to return to the Superfluous
Mansion.&nbsp; He sneaked into the hall and stole on tiptoe to
the cupboard where he kept his money.&nbsp; Yet half a minute, he
told himself, and he would be free for days from his obseding
lodger, and might decide at leisure on the course he should
pursue.&nbsp; But fate had otherwise designed: there came a tap
at the door and Zero entered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have I caught you?&rsquo; he cried, with innocent
gaiety.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear fellow, I was growing quite
impatient.&rsquo;&nbsp; And on the speaker&rsquo;s somewhat
stolid face, there came a glow of genuine affection.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am so long unused to have a friend,&rsquo; he continued,
&lsquo;that I begin to be afraid I may prove
jealous.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he wrung the hand of his landlord.</p>
<p>Somerset was, of all men, least fit to deal with such a
greeting.&nbsp; To reject these kind advances was beyond his
strength.&nbsp; That he could not return cordiality for
cordiality, was already almost more than he could carry.&nbsp;
That inequality between kind sentiments which, to generous
characters, will always seem to be a sort of guilt, oppressed him
to the ground; and he stammered vague and lying words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is all right,&rsquo; cried Zero&mdash;&lsquo;that
is as it should be&mdash;say no more!&nbsp; I had a vague alarm;
I feared you had deserted me; but I now own that fear to have
been unworthy, and apologise.&nbsp; To doubt of your forgiveness
were to repeat my sin.&nbsp; Come, then; dinner waits; join me
again and tell me your adventures of the night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kindness still sealed the lips of Somerset; and he suffered
himself once more to be set down to table with his innocent and
criminal acquaintance.&nbsp; Once more, the plotter plunged up to
the neck in damaging disclosures: now it would be the name and
biography of an individual, now the address of some important
centre, that rose, as if by accident, upon his lips; and each
word was like another turn of the thumbscrew to his unhappy
guest.&nbsp; Finally, the course of Zero&rsquo;s bland monologue
led him to the young lady of two days ago: that young lady, who
had flashed on Somerset for so brief a while but with so
conquering a charm; and whose engaging grace, communicative eyes,
and admirable conduct of the sweeping skirt, remained imprinted
on his memory.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You saw her?&rsquo; said Zero.&nbsp; &lsquo;Beautiful,
is she not?&nbsp; She, too, is one of ours: a true enthusiast:
nervous, perhaps, in presence of the chemicals; but in matters of
intrigue, the very soul of skill and daring.&nbsp; Lake,
Fonblanque, de Marly, Valdevia, such are some of the names that
she employs; her true name&mdash;but there, perhaps, I go too
far.&nbsp; Suffice it, that it is to her I owe my present
lodging, and, dear Somerset, the pleasure of your
acquaintance.&nbsp; It appears she knew the house.&nbsp; You see
dear fellow, I make no concealment: all that you can care to
hear, I tell you openly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; cried the wretched
Somerset, &lsquo;hold your tongue!&nbsp; You cannot imagine how
you torture me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A shade of serious discomposure crossed the open countenance
of Zero.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are times,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;when I begin to
fancy that you do not like me.&nbsp; Why, why, dear Somerset,
this lack of cordiality?&nbsp; I am depressed; the touchstone of
my life draws near; and if I fail&rsquo;&mdash;he gloomily
nodded&mdash;&lsquo;from all the height of my ambitious schemes,
I fall, dear boy, into contempt.&nbsp; These are grave thoughts,
and you may judge my need of your delightful company.&nbsp;
Innocent prattler, you relieve the weight of my concerns.&nbsp;
And yet . . . and yet . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; The speaker pushed away
his plate, and rose from table.&nbsp; &lsquo;Follow me,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;follow me.&nbsp; My mood is on; I must have air,
I must behold the plain of battle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he led the way hurriedly to the top flat of the
mansion, and thence, by ladder and trap, to a certain leaded
platform, sheltered at one end by a great stalk of chimneys and
occupying the actual summit of the roof.&nbsp; On both sides, it
bordered, without parapet or rail, on the incline of slates; and,
northward above all, commanded an extensive view of housetops,
and rising through the smoke, the distant spires of churches.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; cried Zero, &lsquo;you behold this field
of city, rich, crowded, laughing with the spoil of continents;
but soon, how soon, to be laid low!&nbsp; Some day, some night,
from this coign of vantage, you shall perhaps be startled by the
detonation of the judgment gun&mdash;not sharp and empty like the
crack of cannon, but deep-mouthed and unctuously solemn.&nbsp;
Instantly thereafter, you shall behold the flames break
forth.&nbsp; Ay,&rsquo; he cried, stretching forth his hand,
&lsquo;ay, that will be a day of retribution.&nbsp; Then shall
the pallid constable flee side by side with the detected
thief.&nbsp; Blaze!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;blaze, derided
city!&nbsp; Fall, flatulent monarchy, fall like Dagon!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With these words his foot slipped upon the lead; and but for
Somerset&rsquo;s quickness, he had been instantly precipitated
into space.&nbsp; Pale as a sheet, and limp as a
pocket-handkerchief, he was dragged from the edge of downfall by
one arm; helped, or rather carried, down the ladder; and
deposited in safety on the attic landing.&nbsp; Here he began to
come to himself, wiped his brow, and at length, seizing
Somerset&rsquo;s hand in both of his, began to utter his
acknowledgments.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This seals it,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ours is a
life and death connection.&nbsp; You have plucked me from the
jaws of death; and if I were before attracted by your character,
judge now of the ardour of my gratitude and love!&nbsp; But I
perceive I am still greatly shaken.&nbsp; Lend me, I beseech you,
lend me your arm as far as my apartment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A dram of spirits restored the plotter to something of his
customary self-possession; and he was standing, glass in hand and
genially convalescent, when his eye was attracted by the
dejection of the unfortunate young man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good heavens, dear Somerset,&rsquo; he cried,
&lsquo;what ails you?&nbsp; Let me offer you a touch of
spirits.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Somerset had fallen below the reach of this material
comfort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me be,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am lost; you
have caught me in the toils.&nbsp; Up to this moment, I have
lived all my life in the most reckless manner, and done exactly
what I pleased, with the most perfect innocence.&nbsp; And
now&mdash;what am I?&nbsp; Are you so blind and wooden that you
do not see the loathing you inspire me with?&nbsp; Is it possible
you can suppose me willing to continue to exist upon such
terms?&nbsp; To think,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;that a young man,
guilty of no fault on earth but amiability, should find himself
involved in such a damned imbroglio!&rsquo;&nbsp; And placing his
knuckles in his eyes, Somerset rolled upon the sofa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My God,&rsquo; said Zero, &lsquo;is this
possible?&nbsp; And I so filled with tenderness and
interest!&nbsp; Can it be, dear Somerset, that you are under the
empire of these out-worn scruples? or that you judge a patriot by
the morality of the religious tract?&nbsp; I thought you were a
good agnostic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Jones,&rsquo; said Somerset, &lsquo;it is in vain
to argue.&nbsp; I boast myself a total disbeliever, not only in
revealed religion, but in the data, method, and conclusions of
the whole of ethics.&nbsp; Well! what matters it? what signifies
a form of words?&nbsp; I regard you as a reptile, whom I would
rejoice, whom I long, to stamp under my heel.&nbsp; You would
blow up others?&nbsp; Well then, understand: I want, with every
circumstance of infamy and agony, to blow up you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Somerset, Somerset!&rsquo; said Zero, turning very
pale, &lsquo;this is wrong; this is very wrong.&nbsp; You pain,
you wound me, Somerset.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me a match!&rsquo; cried Somerset wildly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Let me set fire to this incomparable monster!&nbsp; Let me
perish with him in his fall!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; cried Zero, clutching hold
of the young man, &lsquo;for God&rsquo;s sake command
yourself!&nbsp; We stand upon the brink; death yawns around us; a
man&mdash;a stranger in this foreign land&mdash;one whom you have
called your friend&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silence!&rsquo; cried Somerset, &lsquo;you are no
friend, no friend of mine.&nbsp; I look on you with loathing,
like a toad: my flesh creeps with physical repulsion; my soul
revolts against the sight of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Zero burst into tears.&nbsp; &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; he sobbed,
&lsquo;this snaps the last link that bound me to humanity.&nbsp;
My friend disowns&mdash;he insults me.&nbsp; I am indeed
accurst.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somerset stood for an instant staggered by this sudden change
of front.&nbsp; The next moment, with a despairing gesture, he
fled from the room and from the house.&nbsp; The first dash of
his escape carried him hard upon half-way to the next
police-office: but presently began to droop; and before he
reached the house of lawful intervention, he fell once more among
doubtful counsels.&nbsp; Was he an agnostic? had he a right to
act?&nbsp; Away with such nonsense, and let Zero perish! ran his
thoughts.&nbsp; And then again: had he not promised, had he not
shaken hands and broken bread? and that with open eyes? and if so
how could he take action, and not forfeit honour?&nbsp; But
honour? what was honour?&nbsp; A figment, which, in the hot
pursuit of crime, he ought to dash aside.&nbsp; Ay, but
crime?&nbsp; A figment, too, which his enfranchised intellect
discarded.&nbsp; All day, he wandered in the parks, a prey to
whirling thoughts; all night, patrolled the city; and at the peep
of day he sat down by the wayside in the neighbourhood of Peckham
and bitterly wept.&nbsp; His gods had fallen.&nbsp; He who had
chosen the broad, daylit, unencumbered paths of universal
scepticism, found himself still the bondslave of honour.&nbsp; He
who had accepted life from a point of view as lofty as the
predatory eagle&rsquo;s, though with no design to prey; he who
had clearly recognised the common moral basis of war, of
commercial competition, and of crime; he who was prepared to help
the escaping murderer or to embrace the impenitent thief, found,
to the overthrow of all his logic, that he objected to the use of
dynamite.&nbsp; The dawn crept among the sleeping villas and over
the smokeless fields of city; and still the unfortunate sceptic
sobbed over his fall from consistency.</p>
<p>At length, he rose and took the rising sun to witness.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is no question as to fact,&rsquo; he cried;
&lsquo;right and wrong are but figments and the shadow of a word;
but for all that, there are certain things that I cannot do, and
there are certain others that I will not stand.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Thereupon he decided to return to make one last effort of
persuasion, and, if he could not prevail on Zero to desist from
his infernal trade, throw delicacy to the winds, give the plotter
an hour&rsquo;s start, and denounce him to the police.&nbsp; Fast
as he went, being winged by this resolution, it was already well
on in the morning when he came in sight of the Superfluous
Mansion.&nbsp; Tripping down the steps, was the young lady of the
various aliases; and he was surprised to see upon her countenance
the marks of anger and concern.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; he began, yielding to impulse and with no
clear knowledge of what he was to add.</p>
<p>But at the sound of his voice she seemed to experience a shock
of fear or horror; started back; lowered her veil with a sudden
movement; and fled, without turning, from the square.</p>
<p>Here then, we step aside a moment from following the fortunes
of Somerset, and proceed to relate the strange and romantic
episode of <span class="smcap">The Brown Box</span>.</p>
<h2><!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>DESBOROUGH&rsquo;S ADVENTURE</h2>
<h3><i>THE BROWN BOX</i></h3>
<p>Mr. Harry Desborough lodged in the fine and grave old quarter
of Bloomsbury, roared about on every side by the high tides of
London, but itself rejoicing in romantic silences and city
peace.&nbsp; It was in Queen Square that he had pitched his tent,
next door to the Children&rsquo;s Hospital, on your left hand as
you go north: Queen Square, sacred to humane and liberal arts,
whence homes were made beautiful, where the poor were taught,
where the sparrows were plentiful and loud, and where groups of
patient little ones would hover all day long before the hospital,
if by chance they might kiss their hand or speak a word to their
sick brother at the window.&nbsp; Desborough&rsquo;s room was on
the first floor and fronted to the square; but he enjoyed
besides, a right by which he often profited, to sit and smoke
upon a terrace at the back, which looked down upon a fine forest
of back gardens, and was in turn commanded by the windows of an
empty room.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of a warm day, Desborough sauntered forth
upon this terrace, somewhat out of hope and heart, for he had
been now some weeks on the vain quest of situations, and prepared
for melancholy and tobacco.&nbsp; Here, at least, he told himself
that he would be alone; for, like most youths, who are neither
rich, nor witty, nor successful, he rather shunned than courted
the society of other men.&nbsp; Even as he expressed the thought,
his eye alighted on the window of the room that looked upon the
terrace; and to his surprise and annoyance, he beheld it
curtained with a silken hanging.&nbsp; It was like his luck, he
thought; his privacy was gone, he could no longer brood and sigh
unwatched, he could no longer suffer his discouragement to find a
vent in words or soothe himself with sentimental whistling; and
in the irritation of the moment, he struck his pipe upon the rail
with unnecessary force.&nbsp; It was an old, sweet, seasoned
briar-root, glossy and dark with long employment, and justly dear
to his fancy.&nbsp; What, then, was his chagrin, when the head
snapped from the stem, leaped airily in space, and fell and
disappeared among the lilacs of the garden?</p>
<p>He threw himself savagely into the garden chair, pulled out
the story-paper which he had brought with him to read, tore off a
fragment of the last sheet, which contains only the answers to
correspondents, and set himself to roll a cigarette.&nbsp; He was
no master of the art; again and again, the paper broke between
his fingers and the tobacco showered upon the ground; and he was
already on the point of angry resignation, when the window swung
slowly inward, the silken curtain was thrust aside, and a lady,
somewhat strangely attired, stepped forth upon the terrace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Se&ntilde;orito,&rsquo; said she, and there was a rich
thrill in her voice, like an organ note, &lsquo;Se&ntilde;orito,
you are in difficulties.&nbsp; Suffer me to come to your
assistance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With the words, she took the paper and tobacco from his
unresisting hands; and with a facility that, in
Desborough&rsquo;s eyes, seemed magical, rolled and presented him
a cigarette.&nbsp; He took it, still seated, still without a
word; staring with all his eyes upon that apparition.&nbsp; Her
face was warm and rich in colour; in shape, it was that piquant
triangle, so innocently sly, so saucily attractive, so rare in
our more northern climates; her eyes were large, starry, and
visited by changing lights; her hair was partly covered by a lace
mantilla, through which her arms, bare to the shoulder, gleamed
white; her figure, full and soft in all the womanly contours, was
yet alive and active, light with excess of life, and slender by
grace of some divine proportion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not like my cigarrito, Se&ntilde;or?&rsquo; she
asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yet it is better made than
yours.&rsquo;&nbsp; At that she laughed, and her laughter trilled
in his ear like music; but the next moment her face fell.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is my manner that
repels you.&nbsp; I am too constrained, too cold.&nbsp; I am
not,&rsquo; she added, with a more engaging air, &lsquo;I am not
the simple English maiden I appear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; murmured Harry, filled with inexpressible
thoughts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In my own dear land,&rsquo; she pursued, &lsquo;things
are differently ordered.&nbsp; There, I must own, a girl is bound
by many and rigorous restrictions; little is permitted her; she
learns to be distant, she learns to appear forbidding.&nbsp; But
here, in free England&mdash;oh, glorious liberty!&rsquo; she
cried, and threw up her arms with a gesture of inimitable
grace&mdash;&lsquo;here there are no fetters; here the woman may
dare to be herself entirely, and the men, the chivalrous
men&mdash;is it not written on the very shield of your nation,
<i>honi soit</i>?&nbsp; Ah, it is hard for me to learn, hard for
me to dare to be myself.&nbsp; You must not judge me yet awhile;
I shall end by conquering this stiffness, I shall end by growing
English.&nbsp; Do I speak the language well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perfectly&mdash;oh, perfectly!&rsquo; said Harry, with
a fervency of conviction worthy of a graver subject.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, then,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I shall soon learn;
English blood ran in my father&rsquo;s veins; and I have had the
advantage of some training in your expressive tongue.&nbsp; If I
speak already without accent, with my thorough English
appearance, there is nothing left to change except my
manners.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no,&rsquo; said Desborough.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh pray
not!&nbsp; I&mdash;madam&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am,&rsquo; interrupted the lady, &lsquo;the
Se&ntilde;orita Teresa Valdevia.&nbsp; The evening air grows
chill.&nbsp; Adios, Se&ntilde;orito.&rsquo;&nbsp; And before
Harry could stammer out a word, she had disappeared into her
room.</p>
<p>He stood transfixed, the cigarette still unlighted in his
hand.&nbsp; His thoughts had soared above tobacco, and still
recalled and beautified the image of his new acquaintance.&nbsp;
Her voice re-echoed in his memory; her eyes, of which he could
not tell the colour, haunted his soul.&nbsp; The clouds had risen
at her coming, and he beheld a new-created world.&nbsp; What she
was, he could not fancy, but he adored her.&nbsp; Her age, he
durst not estimate; fearing to find her older than himself, and
thinking sacrilege to couple that fair favour with the thought of
mortal changes.&nbsp; As for her character, beauty to the young
is always good.&nbsp; So the poor lad lingered late upon the
terrace, stealing timid glances at the curtained window, sighing
to the gold laburnums, rapt into the country of romance; and when
at length he entered and sat down to dine, on cold boiled mutton
and a pint of ale, he feasted on the food of gods.</p>
<p>Next day when he returned to the terrace, the window was a
little ajar, and he enjoyed a view of the lady&rsquo;s shoulder,
as she sat patiently sewing and all unconscious of his
presence.&nbsp; On the next, he had scarce appeared when the
window opened, and the Se&ntilde;orita tripped forth into the
sunlight, in a morning disorder, delicately neat, and yet somehow
foreign, tropical, and strange.&nbsp; In one hand she held a
packet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you try,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;some of my
father&rsquo;s tobacco&mdash;from dear Cuba?&nbsp; There, as I
suppose you know, all smoke, ladies as well as gentlemen.&nbsp;
So you need not fear to annoy me.&nbsp; The fragrance will remind
me of home.&nbsp; My home, Se&ntilde;or, was by the
sea.&rsquo;&nbsp; And as she uttered these few words, Desborough,
for the first time in his life, realised the poetry of the great
deep.&nbsp; &lsquo;Awake or asleep, I dream of it: dear home,
dear Cuba!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But some day,&rsquo; said Desborough, with an inward
pang, &lsquo;some day you will return?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never!&rsquo; she cried; &lsquo;ah, never, in
Heaven&rsquo;s name!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you then resident for life in England?&rsquo; he
inquired, with a strange lightening of spirit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ask too much, for you ask more than I know,&rsquo;
she answered sadly; and then, resuming her gaiety of manner:
&lsquo;But you have not tried my Cuban tobacco,&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Se&ntilde;orita,&rsquo; said he, shyly abashed by some
shadow of coquetry in her manner, &lsquo;whatever comes to
me&mdash;you&mdash;I mean,&rsquo; he concluded, deeply flushing,
&lsquo;that I have no doubt the tobacco is delightful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Se&ntilde;or,&rsquo; she said, with almost mournful
gravity, &lsquo;you seemed so simple and good, and already you
are trying to pay compliments&mdash;and besides,&rsquo; she
added, brightening, with a quick upward glance, into a smile,
&lsquo;you do it so badly!&nbsp; English gentlemen, I used to
hear, could be fast friends, respectful, honest friends; could be
companions, comforters, if the need arose, or champions, and yet
never encroach.&nbsp; Do not seek to please me by copying the
graces of my countrymen.&nbsp; Be yourself: the frank, kindly,
honest English gentleman that I have heard of since my childhood
and still longed to meet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harry, much bewildered, and far from clear as to the manners
of the Cuban gentlemen, strenuously disclaimed the thought of
plagiarism.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your national seriousness of bearing best becomes you,
Se&ntilde;or,&rsquo; said the lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;See!&rsquo;
marking a line with her dainty, slippered foot, &lsquo;thus far
it shall be common ground; there, at my window-sill, begins the
scientific frontier.&nbsp; If you choose, you may drive me to my
forts; but if, on the other hand, we are to be real English
friends, I may join you here when I am not too sad; or, when I am
yet more graciously inclined, you may draw your chair beside the
window and teach me English customs, while I work.&nbsp; You will
find me an apt scholar, for my heart is in the task.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She laid her hand lightly upon Harry&rsquo;s arm, and looked into
his eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you know,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I am
emboldened to believe that I have already caught something of
your English aplomb?&nbsp; Do you not perceive a change,
Se&ntilde;or?&nbsp; Slight, perhaps, but still a change?&nbsp; Is
my deportment not more open, more free, more like that of the
dear &ldquo;British Miss&rdquo; than when you saw me
first?&rsquo;&nbsp; She gave a radiant smile; withdrew her hand
from Harry&rsquo;s arm; and before the young man could formulate
in words the eloquent emotions that ran riot through his
brain&mdash;with an &lsquo;Adios, Se&ntilde;or: good-night, my
English friend,&rsquo; she vanished from his sight behind the
curtain.</p>
<p>The next day Harry consumed an ounce of tobacco in vain upon
the neutral terrace; neither sight nor sound rewarded him, and
the dinner-hour summoned him at length from the scene of
disappointment.&nbsp; On the next it rained; but nothing, neither
business nor weather, neither prospective poverty nor present
hardship, could now divert the young man from the service of his
lady; and wrapt in a long ulster, with the collar raised, he took
his stand against the balustrade, awaiting fortune, the picture
of damp and discomfort to the eye, but glowing inwardly with
tender and delightful ardours.&nbsp; Presently the window opened,
and the fair Cuban, with a smile imperfectly dissembled, appeared
upon the sill.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come here,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;here, beside my
window.&nbsp; The small verandah gives a belt of
shelter.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she graciously handed him a
folding-chair.</p>
<p>As he sat down, visibly aglow with shyness and delight, a
certain bulkiness in his pocket reminded him that he was not come
empty-handed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have taken the liberty,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;of
bringing you a little book.&nbsp; I thought of you, when I
observed it on the stall, because I saw it was in Spanish.&nbsp;
The man assured me it was by one of the best authors, and quite
proper.&rsquo;&nbsp; As he spoke, he placed the little volume in
her hand.&nbsp; Her eyes fell as she turned the pages, and a
flush rose and died again upon her cheeks, as deep as it was
fleeting.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are angry,&rsquo; he cried in
agony.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have presumed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Se&ntilde;or, it is not that,&rsquo; returned the
lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&mdash;&rsquo; and a flood of colour once
more mounted to her brow&mdash;&lsquo;I am confused and ashamed
because I have deceived you.&nbsp; Spanish,&rsquo; she began, and
paused&mdash;&lsquo;Spanish is, of course, my native
tongue,&rsquo; she resumed, as though suddenly taking courage;
&lsquo;and this should certainly put the highest value on your
thoughtful present; but alas, sir, of what use is it to me?&nbsp;
And how shall I confess to you the truth&mdash;the humiliating
truth&mdash;that I cannot read?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Harry&rsquo;s eyes met hers in undisguised amazement, the
fair Cuban seemed to shrink before his gaze.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Read?&rsquo; repeated Harry.&nbsp; &lsquo;You!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She pushed the window still more widely open with a large and
noble gesture.&nbsp; &lsquo;Enter, Se&ntilde;or,&rsquo; said
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;The time has come to which I have long looked
forward, not without alarm; when I must either fear to lose your
friendship, or tell you without disguise the story of my
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was with a sentiment bordering on devotion, that Harry
passed the window.&nbsp; A semi-barbarous delight in form and
colour had presided over the studied disorder of the room in
which he found himself.&nbsp; It was filled with dainty stuffs,
furs and rugs and scarves of brilliant hues, and set with elegant
and curious trifles-fans on the mantelshelf, an antique lamp upon
a bracket, and on the table a silver-mounted bowl of cocoa-nut
about half full of unset jewels.&nbsp; The fair Cuban, herself a
gem of colour and the fit masterpiece for that rich frame,
motioned Harry to a seat, and sinking herself into another, thus
began her history.</p>
<h3><!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span><i>STORY OF THE FAIR CUBAN</i></h3>
<p>I am not what I seem.&nbsp; My father drew his descent, on the
one hand, from grandees of Spain, and on the other, through the
maternal line, from the patriot Bruce.&nbsp; My mother, too, was
the descendant of a line of kings; but, alas! these kings were
African.&nbsp; She was fair as the day: fairer than I, for I
inherited a darker strain of blood from the veins of my European
father; her mind was noble, her manners queenly and accomplished;
and seeing her more than the equal of her neighbours, and
surrounded by the most considerate affection and respect, I grew
up to adore her, and when the time came, received her last sigh
upon my lips, still ignorant that she was a slave, and alas! my
father&rsquo;s mistress.&nbsp; Her death, which befell me in my
sixteenth year, was the first sorrow I had known: it left our
home bereaved of its attractions, cast a shade of melancholy on
my youth, and wrought in my father a tragic and durable
change.&nbsp; Months went by; with the elasticity of my years, I
regained some of the simple mirth that had before distinguished
me; the plantation smiled with fresh crops; the negroes on the
estate had already forgotten my mother and transferred their
simple obedience to myself; but still the cloud only darkened on
the brows of Se&ntilde;or Valdevia.&nbsp; His absences from home
had been frequent even in the old days, for he did business in
precious gems in the city of Havana; they now became almost
continuous; and when he returned, it was but for the night and
with the manner of a man crushed down by adverse fortune.</p>
<p>The place where I was born and passed my days was an isle set
in the Caribbean Sea, some half-hour&rsquo;s rowing from the
coasts of Cuba.&nbsp; It was steep, rugged, and, except for my
father&rsquo;s family and plantation, uninhabited and left to
nature.&nbsp; The house, a low building surrounded by spacious
verandahs, stood upon a rise of ground and looked across the sea
to Cuba.&nbsp; The breezes blew about it gratefully, fanned us as
we lay swinging in our silken hammocks, and tossed the boughs and
flowers of the magnolia.&nbsp; Behind and to the left, the
quarter of the negroes and the waving fields of the plantation
covered an eighth part of the surface of the isle.&nbsp; On the
right and closely bordering on the garden, lay a vast and deadly
swamp, densely covered with wood, breathing fever, dotted with
profound sloughs, and inhabited by poisonous oysters, man-eating
crabs, snakes, alligators, and sickly fishes.&nbsp; Into the
recesses of that jungle, none could penetrate but those of
African descent; an invisible, unconquerable foe lay there in
wait for the European; and the air was death.</p>
<p>One morning (from which I must date the beginning of my
ruinous misfortune) I left my room a little after day, for in
that warm climate all are early risers, and found not a servant
to attend upon my wants.&nbsp; I made the circuit of the house,
still calling: and my surprise had almost changed into alarm,
when coming at last into a large verandahed court, I found it
thronged with negroes.&nbsp; Even then, even when I was amongst
them, not one turned or paid the least regard to my
arrival.&nbsp; They had eyes and ears for but one person: a
woman, richly and tastefully attired; of elegant carriage, and a
musical speech; not so much old in years, as worn and marred by
self-indulgence: her face, which was still attractive, stamped
with the most cruel passions, her eye burning with the greed of
evil.&nbsp; It was not from her appearance, I believe, but from
some emanation of her soul, that I recoiled in a kind of fainting
terror; as we hear of plants that blight and snakes that
fascinate, the woman shocked and daunted me.&nbsp; But I was of a
brave nature; trod the weakness down; and forcing my way through
the slaves, who fell back before me in embarrassment, as though
in the presence of rival mistresses, I asked, in imperious tones:
&lsquo;Who is this person?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A slave girl, to whom I had been kind, whispered in my ear to
have a care, for that was Madam Mendizabal; but the name was new
to me.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the woman, applying a pair of glasses to her
eyes, studied me with insolent particularity from head to
foot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Young woman,&rsquo; said she, at last, &lsquo;I have
had a great experience in refractory servants, and take a pride
in breaking them.&nbsp; You really tempt me; and if I had not
other affairs, and these of more importance, on my hand, I should
certainly buy you at your father&rsquo;s sale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam&mdash;&rsquo; I began, but my voice failed
me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it possible that you do not know your
position?&rsquo; she returned, with a hateful laugh.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How comical!&nbsp; Positively, I must buy her.&nbsp;
Accomplishments, I suppose?&rsquo; she added, turning to the
servants.</p>
<p>Several assured her that the young mistress had been brought
up like any lady, for so it seemed in their inexperience.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She would do very well for my place of business in
Havana,&rsquo; said the Se&ntilde;ora Mendizabal, once more
studying me through her glasses; &lsquo;and I should take a
pleasure,&rsquo; she pursued, more directly addressing myself,
&lsquo;in bringing you acquainted with a whip.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
she smiled at me with a savoury lust of cruelty upon her
face.</p>
<p>At this, I found expression.&nbsp; Calling by name upon the
servants, I bade them turn this woman from the house, fetch her
to the boat, and set her back upon the mainland.&nbsp; But with
one voice, they protested that they durst not obey, coming close
about me, pleading and beseeching me to be more wise; and, when I
insisted, rising higher in passion and speaking of this foul
intruder in the terms she had deserved, they fell back from me as
from one who had blasphemed.&nbsp; A superstitious reverence
plainly encircled the stranger; I could read it in their changed
demeanour, and in the paleness that prevailed upon the natural
colour of their faces; and their fear perhaps reacted on
myself.&nbsp; I looked again at Madam Mendizabal.&nbsp; She stood
perfectly composed, watching my face through her glasses with a
smile of scorn; and at the sight of her assured superiority to
all my threats, a cry broke from my lips, a cry of rage, fear,
and despair, and I fled from the verandah and the house.</p>
<p>I ran I knew not where, but it was towards the beach.&nbsp; As
I went, my head whirled; so strange, so sudden, were these events
and insults.&nbsp; Who was she? what, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, the
power she wielded over my obedient negroes?&nbsp; Why had she
addressed me as a slave? why spoken of my father&rsquo;s
sale?&nbsp; To all these tumultuary questions I could find no
answer; and in the turmoil of my mind, nothing was plain except
the hateful leering image of the woman.</p>
<p>I was still running, mad with fear and anger, when I saw my
father coming to meet me from the landing-place; and with a cry
that I thought would have killed me, leaped into his arms and
broke into a passion of sobs and tears upon his bosom.&nbsp; He
made me sit down below a tall palmetto that grew not far off;
comforted me, but with some abstraction in his voice; and as soon
as I regained the least command upon my feelings, asked me, not
without harshness, what this grief betokened.&nbsp; I was
surprised by his tone into a still greater measure of composure;
and in firm tones, though still interrupted by sobs, I told him
there was a stranger in the island, at which I thought he started
and turned pale; that the servants would not obey me; that the
stranger&rsquo;s name was Madam Mendizabal, and, at that, he
seemed to me both troubled and relieved; that she had insulted
me, treated me as a slave (and here my father&rsquo;s brow began
to darken), threatened to buy me at a sale, and questioned my own
servants before my face; and that, at last, finding myself quite
helpless and exposed to these intolerable liberties, I had fled
from the house in terror, indignation, and amazement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Teresa,&rsquo; said my father, with singular gravity of
voice, &lsquo;I must make to-day a call upon your courage; much
must be told you, there is much that you must do to help me; and
my daughter must prove herself a woman by her spirit.&nbsp; As
for this Mendizabal, what shall I say? or how am I to tell you
what she is?&nbsp; Twenty years ago, she was the loveliest of
slaves; to-day she is what you see her&mdash;prematurely old,
disgraced by the practice of every vice and every nefarious
industry, but free, rich, married, they say, to some reputable
man, whom may Heaven assist! and exercising among her ancient
mates, the slaves of Cuba, an influence as unbounded as its
reason is mysterious.&nbsp; Horrible rites, it is supposed,
cement her empire: the rites of Hoodoo.&nbsp; Be that as it may,
I would have you dismiss the thought of this incomparable witch;
it is not from her that danger threatens us; and into her hands,
I make bold to promise, you shall never fall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father!&rsquo; I cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fall?&nbsp; Was
there any truth, then, in her words?&nbsp; Am I&mdash;O father,
tell me plain; I can bear anything but this suspense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell you,&rsquo; he replied, with merciful
bluntness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your mother was a slave; it was my
design, so soon as I had saved a competence, to sail to the free
land of Britain, where the law would suffer me to marry her: a
design too long procrastinated; for death, at the last moment,
intervened.&nbsp; You will now understand the heaviness with
which your mother&rsquo;s memory hangs about my neck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I cried out aloud, in pity for my parents; and in seeking to
console the survivor, I forgot myself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It matters not,&rsquo; resumed my father.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What I have left undone can never be repaired, and I must
bear the penalty of my remorse.&nbsp; But, Teresa, with so
cutting a reminder of the evils of delay, I set myself at once to
do what was still possible: to liberate yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I began to break forth in thanks, but he checked me with a
sombre roughness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your mother&rsquo;s illness,&rsquo; he resumed,
&lsquo;had engaged too great a portion of my time; my business in
the city had lain too long at the mercy of ignorant underlings;
my head, my taste, my unequalled knowledge of the more precious
stones, that art by which I can distinguish, even on the darkest
night, a sapphire from a ruby, and tell at a glance in what
quarter of the earth a gem was disinterred&mdash;all these had
been too long absent from the conduct of affairs.&nbsp; Teresa, I
was insolvent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What matters that?&rsquo; I cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
matters poverty, if we be left together with our love and sacred
memories?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not comprehend,&rsquo; he said gloomily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Slave, as you are, young&mdash;alas! scarce more than
child!&mdash;accomplished, beautiful with the most touching
beauty, innocent as an angel&mdash;all these qualities that
should disarm the very wolves and crocodiles, are, in the eyes of
those to whom I stand indebted, commodities to buy and
sell.&nbsp; You are a chattel; a marketable thing; and
worth&mdash;heavens, that I should say such words!&mdash;worth
money.&nbsp; Do you begin to see?&nbsp; If I were to give you
freedom, I should defraud my creditors; the manumission would be
certainly annulled; you would be still a slave, and I a
criminal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I caught his hand in mine, kissed it, and moaned in pity for
myself, in sympathy for my father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How I have toiled,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;how I
have dared and striven to repair my losses, Heaven has beheld and
will remember.&nbsp; Its blessing was denied to my endeavours,
or, as I please myself by thinking, but delayed to descend upon
my daughter&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; At length, all hope was at an
end; I was ruined beyond retrieve; a heavy debt fell due upon the
morrow, which I could not meet; I should be declared a bankrupt,
and my goods, my lands, my jewels that I so much loved, my slaves
whom I have spoiled and rendered happy, and oh! tenfold worse,
you, my beloved daughter, would be sold and pass into the hands
of ignorant and greedy traffickers.&nbsp; Too long, I saw, had I
accepted and profited by this great crime of slavery; but was my
daughter, my innocent unsullied daughter, was <i>she</i> to pay
the price?&nbsp; I cried out&mdash;no!&mdash;I took Heaven to
witness my temptation; I caught up this bag and fled.&nbsp; Close
upon my track are the pursuers; perhaps to-night, perhaps
to-morrow, they will land upon this isle, sacred to the memory of
the dear soul that bore you, to consign your father to an
ignominious prison, and yourself to slavery and dishonour.&nbsp;
We have not many hours before us.&nbsp; Off the north coast of
our isle, by strange good fortune, an English yacht has for some
days been hovering.&nbsp; It belongs to Sir George Greville, whom
I slightly know, to whom ere now I have rendered unusual
services, and who will not refuse to help in our escape.&nbsp; Or
if he did, if his gratitude were in default, I have the power to
force him.&nbsp; For what does it mean, my child&mdash;what means
this Englishman, who hangs for years upon the shores of Cuba, and
returns from every trip with new and valuable gems?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He may have found a mine,&rsquo; I hazarded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So he declares,&rsquo; returned my father; &lsquo;but
the strange gift I have received from nature, easily transpierced
the fable.&nbsp; He brought me diamonds only, which I bought, at
first, in innocence; at a second glance, I started; for of these
stones, my child, some had first seen the day in Africa, some in
Brazil; while others, from their peculiar water and rude
workmanship, I divined to be the spoil of ancient temples.&nbsp;
Thus put upon the scent, I made inquiries.&nbsp; Oh, he is
cunning, but I was cunninger than he.&nbsp; He visited, I found,
the shop of every jeweller in town; to one he came with rubies,
to one with emeralds, to one with precious beryl; to all, with
this same story of the mine.&nbsp; But in what mine, what rich
epitome of the earth&rsquo;s surface, were there conjoined the
rubies of Ispahan, the pearls of Coromandel, and the diamonds of
Golconda?&nbsp; No, child, that man, for all his yacht and title,
that man must fear and must obey me.&nbsp; To-night, then, as
soon as it is dark, we must take our way through the swamp by the
path which I shall presently show you; thence, across the
highlands of the isle, a track is blazed, which shall conduct us
to the haven on the north; and close by the yacht is
riding.&nbsp; Should my pursuers come before the hour at which I
look to see them, they will still arrive too late; a trusty man
attends on the mainland; as soon as they appear, we shall behold,
if it be dark, the redness of a fire, if it be day, a pillar of
smoke, on the opposing headland; and thus warned, we shall have
time to put the swamp between ourselves and danger.&nbsp;
Meantime, I would conceal this bag; I would, before all things,
be seen to arrive at the house with empty hands; a blabbing slave
might else undo us.&nbsp; For see!&rsquo; he added; and holding
up the bag, which he had already shown me, he poured into my lap
a shower of unmounted jewels, brighter than flowers, of every
size and colour, and catching, as they fell, upon a million
dainty facets, the ardour of the sun.</p>
<p>I could not restrain a cry of admiration.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even in your ignorant eyes,&rsquo; pursued my father,
&lsquo;they command respect.&nbsp; Yet what are they but pebbles,
passive to the tool, cold as death?&nbsp; Ingrate!&rsquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Each one of these&mdash;miracles of
nature&rsquo;s patience, conceived out of the dust in centuries
of microscopical activity, each one is, for you and me, a year of
life, liberty, and mutual affection.&nbsp; How, then, should I
cherish them! and why do I delay to place them beyond
reach!&nbsp; Teresa, follow me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He rose to his feet, and led me to the borders of the great
jungle, where they overhung, in a wall of poisonous and dusky
foliage, the declivity of the hill on which my father&rsquo;s
house stood planted.&nbsp; For some while he skirted, with
attentive eyes, the margin of the thicket.&nbsp; Then, seeming to
recognise some mark, for his countenance became immediately
lightened of a load of thought, he paused and addressed me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;is the entrance of the secret
path that I have mentioned, and here you shall await me.&nbsp; I
but pass some hundreds of yards into the swamp to bury my poor
treasure; as soon as that is safe, I will return.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
was in vain that I sought to dissuade him, urging the dangers of
the place; in vain that I begged to be allowed to follow,
pleading the black blood that I now knew to circulate in my
veins: to all my appeals he turned a deaf ear, and, bending back
a portion of the screen of bushes, disappeared into the
pestilential silence of the swamp.</p>
<p>At the end of a full hour, the bushes were once more thrust
aside; and my father stepped from out the thicket, and paused and
almost staggered in the first shock of the blinding
sunlight.&nbsp; His face was of a singular dusky red; and yet for
all the heat of the tropical noon, he did not seem to sweat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are tired,&rsquo; I cried, springing to meet
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are ill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am tired,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;the air in that
jungle stifles one; my eyes, besides, have grown accustomed to
its gloom, and the strong sunshine pierces them like
knives.&nbsp; A moment, Teresa, give me but a moment.&nbsp; All
shall yet be well.&nbsp; I have buried the hoard under a cypress,
immediately beyond the bayou, on the left-hand margin of the
path; beautiful, bright things, they now lie whelmed in slime;
you shall find them there, if needful.&nbsp; But come, let us to
the house; it is time to eat against our journey of the night: to
eat and then to sleep, my poor Teresa: then to
sleep.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he looked upon me out of bloodshot eyes,
shaking his head as if in pity.</p>
<p>We went hurriedly, for he kept murmuring that he had been gone
too long, and that the servants might suspect; passed through the
airy stretch of the verandah; and came at length into the
grateful twilight of the shuttered house.&nbsp; The meal was
spread; the house servants, already informed by the boatmen of
the master&rsquo;s return, were all back at their posts, and
terrified, as I could see, to face me.&nbsp; My father still
murmuring of haste with weary and feverish pertinacity, I hurried
at once to take my place at table; but I had no sooner left his
arm than he paused and thrust forth both his hands with a strange
gesture of groping.&nbsp; &lsquo;How is this?&rsquo; he cried, in
a sharp, unhuman voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Am I blind?&rsquo;&nbsp; I
ran to him and tried to lead him to the table; but he resisted
and stood stiffly where he was, opening and shutting his jaws, as
if in a painful effort after breath.&nbsp; Then suddenly he
raised both hands to his temples, cried out, &lsquo;My head, my
head!&rsquo; and reeled and fell against the wall.</p>
<p>I knew too well what it must be.&nbsp; I turned and begged the
servants to relieve him.&nbsp; But they, with one accord, denied
the possibility of hope; the master had gone into the swamp, they
said, the master must die; all help was idle.&nbsp; Why should I
dwell upon his sufferings?&nbsp; I had him carried to a bed, and
watched beside him.&nbsp; He lay still, and at times ground his
teeth, and talked at times unintelligibly, only that one word of
hurry, hurry, coming distinctly to my ears, and telling me that,
even in the last struggle with the powers of death, his mind was
still tortured by his daughter&rsquo;s peril.&nbsp; The sun had
gone down, the darkness had fallen, when I perceived that I was
alone on this unhappy earth.&nbsp; What thought had I of flight,
of safety, of the impending dangers of my situation?&nbsp; Beside
the body of my last friend, I had forgotten all except the
natural pangs of my bereavement.</p>
<p>The sun was some four hours above the eastern line, when I was
recalled to a knowledge of the things of earth, by the entrance
of the slave-girl to whom I have already referred.&nbsp; The poor
soul was indeed devotedly attached to me; and it was with
streaming tears that she broke to me the import of her
coming.&nbsp; With the first light of dawn a boat had reached our
landing-place, and set on shore upon our isle (till now so
fortunate) a party of officers bearing a warrant to arrest my
father&rsquo;s person, and a man of a gross body and low manners,
who declared the island, the plantation, and all its human
chattels, to be now his own.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; said my
slave-girl, &lsquo;he must be a politician or some very powerful
sorcerer; for Madam Mendizabal had no sooner seen them coming,
than she took to the woods.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fool,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;it was the officers she
feared; and at any rate why does that beldam still dare to
pollute the island with her presence?&nbsp; And O Cora,&rsquo; I
exclaimed, remembering my grief, &lsquo;what matter all these
troubles to an orphan?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mistress,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I must remind you of
two things.&nbsp; Never speak as you do now of Madam Mendizabal;
or never to a person of colour; for she is the most powerful
woman in this world, and her real name even, if one durst
pronounce it, were a spell to raise the dead.&nbsp; And whatever
you do, speak no more of her to your unhappy Cora; for though it
is possible she may be afraid of the police (and indeed I think
that I have heard she is in hiding), and though I know that you
will laugh and not believe, yet it is true, and proved, and known
that she hears every word that people utter in this whole vast
world; and your poor Cora is already deep enough in her black
books.&nbsp; She looks at me, mistress, till my blood turns
ice.&nbsp; That is the first I had to say; and now for the
second: do, pray, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, bear in mind that you
are no longer the poor Se&ntilde;or&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; He is
gone, dear gentleman; and now you are no more than a common
slave-girl like myself.&nbsp; The man to whom you belong calls
for you; oh, my dear mistress, go at once!&nbsp; With your youth
and beauty, you may still, if you are winning and obedient,
secure yourself an easy life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For a moment I looked on the creature with the indignation you
may conceive; the next, it was gone: she did but speak after her
kind, as the bird sings or cattle bellow.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go,&rsquo;
said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go, Cora.&nbsp; I thank you for your kind
intentions.&nbsp; Leave me alone one moment with my dead father;
and tell this man that I will come at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went: and I, turning to the bed of death, addressed to
those deaf ears the last appeal and defence of my beleaguered
innocence.&nbsp; &lsquo;Father,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;it was your
last thought, even in the pangs of dissolution, that your
daughter should escape disgrace.&nbsp; Here, at your side, I
swear to you that purpose shall be carried out; by what means, I
know not; by crime, if need be; and Heaven forgive both you and
me and our oppressors, and Heaven help my
helplessness!&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon I felt strengthened as by
long repose; stepped to the mirror, ay, even in that chamber of
the dead; hastily arranged my hair, refreshed my tear-worn eyes,
breathed a dumb farewell to the originator of my days and
sorrows; and composing my features to a smile, went forth to meet
my master.</p>
<p>He was in a great, hot bustle, reviewing that house, once
ours, to which he had but now succeeded; a corpulent, sanguine
man of middle age, sensual, vulgar, humorous, and, if I judged
rightly, not ill-disposed by nature.&nbsp; But the sparkle that
came into his eye as he observed me enter, warned me to expect
the worst.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this your late mistress?&rsquo; he inquired of the
slaves; and when he had learnt it was so, instantly dismissed
them.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, my dear,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I am a
plain man: none of your damned Spaniards, but a true blue,
hard-working, honest Englishman.&nbsp; My name is
Caulder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, sir,&rsquo; said I, and curtsied very
smartly as I had seen the servants.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;this is better than I had
expected; and if you choose to be dutiful in the station to which
it has pleased God to call you, you will find me a very kind old
fellow.&nbsp; I like your looks,&rsquo; he added, calling me by
my name, which he scandalously mispronounced.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is
your hair all your own?&rsquo; he then inquired with a certain
sharpness, and coming up to me, as though I were a horse, he
grossly satisfied his doubts.&nbsp; I was all one flame from head
to foot, but I contained my righteous anger and submitted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That is very well,&rsquo; he continued, chucking me good
humouredly under the chin.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will have no cause to
regret coming to old Caulder, eh?&nbsp; But that is by the
way.&nbsp; What is more to the point is this: your late master
was a most dishonest rogue, and levanted with some valuable
property that belonged of rights to me.&nbsp; Now, considering
your relation to him, I regard you as the likeliest person to
know what has become of it; and I warn you, before you answer,
that my whole future kindness will depend upon your
honesty.&nbsp; I am an honest man myself, and expect the same in
my servants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean the jewels?&rsquo; said I, sinking my voice
into a whisper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is just precisely what I do,&rsquo; said he, and
chuckled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush?&rsquo; he repeated.&nbsp; &lsquo;And why
hush?&nbsp; I am on my own place, I would have you to know, and
surrounded by my own lawful servants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are the officers gone?&rsquo; I asked; and oh! how my
hopes hung upon the answer!</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are,&rsquo; said he, looking somewhat
disconcerted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why do you ask?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you had kept them,&rsquo; I answered, solemnly
enough, although my heart at that same moment leaped with
exultation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Master, I must not conceal from you the
truth.&nbsp; The servants on this estate are in a dangerous
condition, and mutiny has long been brewing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;I never saw a
milder-looking lot of niggers in my life.&rsquo;&nbsp; But for
all that he turned somewhat pale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did they tell you,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;that
Madam Mendizabal is on the island? that, since her coming, they
obey none but her? that if, this morning, they have received you
with even decent civility, it was only by her orders&mdash;issued
with what after-thought I leave you to consider?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam Jezebel?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, she
is a dangerous devil; the police are after her, besides, for a
whole series of murders; but after all, what then?&nbsp; To be
sure, she has a great influence with you coloured folk.&nbsp; But
what in fortune&rsquo;s name can be her errand here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The jewels,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, sir, had
you seen that treasure, sapphire and emerald and opal, and the
golden topaz, and rubies red as the sunset&mdash;of what
incalculable worth, of what unequalled beauty to the
eye!&mdash;had you seen it, as I have, and alas! as <i>she</i>
has&mdash;you would understand and tremble at your
danger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has seen them!&rsquo; he cried, and I could see by
his face, that my audacity was justified by its success.</p>
<p>I caught his hand in mine.&nbsp; &lsquo;My master,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;I am now yours; it is my duty, it should be my
pleasure, to defend your interests and life.&nbsp; Hear my
advice, then; and, I conjure you, be guided by my prudence.&nbsp;
Follow me privily; let none see where we are going; I will lead
you to the place where the treasure has been buried; that once
disinterred, let us make straight for the boat, escape to the
mainland, and not return to this dangerous isle without the
countenance of soldiers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What free man in a free land would have credited so sudden a
devotion?&nbsp; But this oppressor, through the very arts and
sophistries he had abused, to quiet the rebellion of his
conscience and to convince himself that slavery was natural, fell
like a child into the trap I laid for him.&nbsp; He praised and
thanked me; told me I had all the qualities he valued in a
servant; and when he had questioned me further as to the nature
and value of the treasure, and I had once more artfully inflamed
his greed, bade me without delay proceed to carry out my plan of
action.</p>
<p>From a shed in the garden, I took a pick and shovel; and
thence, by devious paths among the magnolias, led my master to
the entrance of the swamp.&nbsp; I walked first, carrying, as I
was now in duty bound, the tools, and glancing continually behind
me, lest we should be spied upon and followed.&nbsp; When we were
come as far as the beginning of the path, it flashed into my mind
I had forgotten meat; and leaving Mr. Caulder in the shadow of a
tree, I returned alone to the house for a basket of
provisions.&nbsp; Were they for him?&nbsp; I asked myself.&nbsp;
And a voice within me answered, No. While we were face to face,
while I still saw before my eyes the man to whom I belonged as
the hand belongs to the body, my indignation held me bravely
up.&nbsp; But now that I was alone, I conceived a sickness at
myself and my designs that I could scarce endure; I longed to
throw myself at his feet, avow my intended treachery, and warn
him from that pestilential swamp, to which I was decoying him to
die; but my vow to my dead father, my duty to my innocent youth,
prevailed upon these scruples; and though my face was pale and
must have reflected the horror that oppressed my spirits, it was
with a firm step that I returned to the borders of the swamp, and
with smiling lips that I bade him rise and follow me.</p>
<p>The path on which we now entered was cut, like a tunnel,
through the living jungle.&nbsp; On either hand and overhead, the
mass of foliage was continuously joined; the day sparingly
filtered through the depth of super-impending wood; and the air
was hot like steam, and heady with vegetable odours, and lay like
a load upon the lungs and brain.&nbsp; Underfoot, a great depth
of mould received our silent footprints; on each side, mimosas,
as tall as a man, shrank from my passing skirts with a continuous
hissing rustle; and but for these sentient vegetables, all in
that den of pestilence was motionless and noiseless.</p>
<p>We had gone but a little way in, when Mr. Caulder was seized
with sudden nausea, and must sit down a moment on the path.&nbsp;
My heart yearned, as I beheld him; and I seriously begged the
doomed mortal to return upon his steps.&nbsp; What were a few
jewels in the scales with life? I asked.&nbsp; But no, he said;
that witch Madam Jezebel would find them out; he was an honest
man, and would not stand to be defrauded, and so forth, panting
the while, like a sick dog.&nbsp; Presently he got to his feet
again, protesting he had conquered his uneasiness; but as we
again began to go forward, I saw in his changed countenance, the
first approaches of death.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Master,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you look pale, deathly
pale; your pallor fills me with dread.&nbsp; Your eyes are
bloodshot; they are red like the rubies that we seek.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wench,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;look before you; look at
your steps.&nbsp; I declare to Heaven, if you annoy me once again
by looking back, I shall remind you of the change in your
position.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A little after, I observed a worm upon the ground, and told,
in a whisper, that its touch was death.&nbsp; Presently a great
green serpent, vivid as the grass in spring, wound rapidly across
the path; and once again I paused and looked back at my
companion, with a horror in my eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;The coffin
snake,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;the snake that dogs its victim like
a hound.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he was not to be dissuaded.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am an old
traveller,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is a foul jungle
indeed; but we shall soon be at an end.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said I, looking at him, with a strange
smile, &lsquo;what end?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he laughed again and again, but not very heartily;
and then, perceiving that the path began to widen and grow
higher, &lsquo;There!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;What did I
tell you?&nbsp; We are past the worst.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, we had now come to the bayou, which was in that place
very narrow and bridged across by a fallen trunk; but on either
hand we could see it broaden out, under a cavern of great arms of
trees and hanging creepers: sluggish, putrid, of a horrible and
sickly stench, floated on by the flat heads of alligators, and
its banks alive with scarlet crabs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If we fall from that unsteady bridge,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;see, where the caiman lies ready to devour us!&nbsp; If,
by the least divergence from the path, we should be snared in a
morass, see, where those myriads of scarlet vermin scour the
border of the thicket!&nbsp; Once helpless, how they would swarm
together to the assault!&nbsp; What could man do against a
thousand of such mailed assailants?&nbsp; And what a death were
that, to perish alive under their claws.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you mad, girl?&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I bid
you be silent and lead on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again I looked upon him, half relenting; and at that he raised
the stick that was in his hand and cruelly struck me on the
face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lead on!&rsquo; he cried again.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Must I be all day, catching my death in this vile slough,
and all for a prating slave-girl?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I took the blow in silence, I took it smiling; but the blood
welled back upon my heart.&nbsp; Something, I know not what, fell
at that moment with a dull plunge in the waters of the lagoon,
and I told myself it was my pity that had fallen.</p>
<p>On the farther side, to which we now hastily scrambled, the
wood was not so dense, the web of creepers not so solidly
convolved.&nbsp; It was possible, here and there, to mark a patch
of somewhat brighter daylight, or to distinguish, through the
lighter web of parasites, the proportions of some soaring
tree.&nbsp; The cypress on the left stood very visibly forth,
upon the edge of such a clearing; the path in that place widened
broadly; and there was a patch of open ground, beset with
horrible ant-heaps, thick with their artificers.&nbsp; I laid
down the tools and basket by the cypress root, where they were
instantly blackened over with the crawling ants; and looked once
more in the face of my unconscious victim.&nbsp; Mosquitoes and
foul flies wove so close a veil between us that his features were
obscured; and the sound of their flight was like the turning of a
mighty wheel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;is the spot.&nbsp; I cannot
dig, for I have not learned to use such instruments; but, for
your own sake, I beseech you to be swift in what you
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had sunk once more upon the ground, panting like a fish;
and I saw rising in his face the same dusky flush that had
mantled on my father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &lsquo;I feel ill,&rsquo; he
gasped, &lsquo;horribly ill; the swamp turns around me; the drone
of these carrion flies confounds me.&nbsp; Have you not
wine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I gave him a glass, and he drank greedily.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is
for you to think,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if you should further
persevere.&nbsp; The swamp has an ill name.&rsquo;&nbsp; And at
the word I ominously nodded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me the pick,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where
are the jewels buried?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I told him vaguely; and in the sweltering heat and closeness,
and dim twilight of the jungle, he began to wield the pickaxe,
swinging it overhead with the vigour of a healthy man.&nbsp; At
first, there broke forth upon him a strong sweat, that made his
face to shine, and in which the greedy insects settled
thickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To sweat in such a place,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;O
master, is this wise?&nbsp; Fever is drunk in through open
pores.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; he screamed, pausing with the
pick buried in the soil.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you seek to drive me
mad?&nbsp; Do you think I do not understand the danger that I
run?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is all I want,&rsquo; said I: &lsquo;I only wish
you to be swift.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, my mind flitting to my
father&rsquo;s deathbed, I began to murmur, scarce above my
breath, the same vain repetition of words, &lsquo;Hurry, hurry,
hurry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Presently, to my surprise, the treasure-seeker took them up;
and while he still wielded the pick, but now with staggering and
uncertain blows, repeated to himself, as it were the burthen of a
song, &lsquo;Hurry, hurry, hurry;&rsquo; and then again,
&lsquo;There is no time to lose; the marsh has an ill name, ill
name;&rsquo; and then back to &lsquo;Hurry, hurry, hurry,&rsquo;
with a dreadful, mechanical, hurried, and yet wearied utterance,
as a sick man rolls upon his pillow.&nbsp; The sweat had
disappeared; he was now dry, but all that I could see of him, of
the same dull brick red.&nbsp; Presently his pick unearthed the
bag of jewels; but he did not observe it, and continued hewing at
the soil.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Master,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;there is the
treasure.&rsquo;&nbsp; He seemed to waken from a dream.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where?&rsquo; he cried; and then, seeing it before his
eyes, &lsquo;Can this be possible?&rsquo; he added.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I must be light-headed.&nbsp; Girl,&rsquo; he cried
suddenly, with the same screaming tone of voice that I had once
before observed, &lsquo;what is wrong? is this swamp
accursed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a grave,&rsquo; I answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will
not go out alive; and as for me, my life is in God&rsquo;s
hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He fell upon the ground like a man struck by a blow, but
whether from the effect of my words, or from sudden seizure of
the malady, I cannot tell.&nbsp; Pretty soon, he raised his
head.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have brought me here to die,&rsquo; he
said; &lsquo;at the risk of your own days, you have condemned
me.&nbsp; Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To save my honour,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bear
me out that I have warned you.&nbsp; Greed of these pebbles, and
not I, has been your undoer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took out his revolver and handed it to me.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
see,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I could have killed you even
yet.&nbsp; But I am dying, as you say; nothing could save me; and
my bill is long enough already.&nbsp; Dear me, dear me,&rsquo; he
said, looking in my face with a curious, puzzled, and pathetic
look, like a dull child at school, &lsquo;if there be a judgment
afterwards, my bill is long enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At that, I broke into a passion of weeping, crawled at his
feet, kissed his hands, begged his forgiveness, put the pistol
back into his grasp and besought him to avenge his death; for
indeed, if with my life I could have bought back his, I had not
balanced at the cost.&nbsp; But he was determined, the poor soul,
that I should yet more bitterly regret my act.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have nothing to forgive,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Dear heaven, what a thing is an old fool!&nbsp; I thought,
upon my word, you had taken quite a fancy to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was seized, at the same time, with a dreadful, swimming
dizziness, clung to me like a child, and called upon the name of
some woman.&nbsp; Presently this spasm, which I watched with
choking tears, lessened and died away; and he came again to the
full possession of his mind.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must write my
will,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Get out my
pocket-book.&rsquo;&nbsp; I did so, and he wrote hurriedly on one
page with a pencil.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do not let my son know,&rsquo;
he said; &lsquo;he is a cruel dog, is my son Philip; do not let
him know how you have paid me out;&rsquo; and then all of a
sudden, &lsquo;God,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;I am blind,&rsquo;
and clapped both hands before his eyes; and then again, and in a
groaning whisper, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me to the
crabs!&rsquo;&nbsp; I swore I would be true to him so long as a
pulse stirred; and I redeemed my promise.&nbsp; I sat there and
watched him, as I had watched my father, but with what different,
with what appalling thoughts!&nbsp; Through the long afternoon,
he gradually sank.&nbsp; All that while, I fought an uphill
battle to shield him from the swarms of ants and the clouds of
mosquitoes: the prisoner of my crime.&nbsp; The night fell, the
roar of insects instantly redoubled in the dark arcades of the
swamp; and still I was not sure that he had breathed his
last.&nbsp; At length, the flesh of his hand, which I yet held in
mine, grew chill between my fingers, and I knew that I was
free.</p>
<p>I took his pocket-book and the revolver, being resolved rather
to die than to be captured, and laden besides with the basket and
the bag of gems, set forward towards the north.&nbsp; The swamp,
at that hour of the night, was filled with a continuous din:
animals and insects of all kinds, and all inimical to life,
contributing their parts.&nbsp; Yet in the midst of this turmoil
of sound, I walked as though my eyes were bandaged, beholding
nothing.&nbsp; The soil sank under my foot, with a horrid,
slippery consistence, as though I were walking among toads; the
touch of the thick wall of foliage, by which alone I guided
myself, affrighted me like the touch of serpents; the darkness
checked my breathing like a gag; indeed, I have never suffered
such extremes of fear as during that nocturnal walk, nor have I
ever known a more sensible relief than when I found the path
beginning to mount and to grow firmer under foot, and saw,
although still some way in front of me, the silver brightness of
the moon.</p>
<p>Presently, I had crossed the last of the jungle, and come
forth amongst noble and lofty woods, clean rock, the clean, dry
dust, the aromatic smell of mountain plants that had been baked
all day in sunlight, and the expressive silence of the
night.&nbsp; My negro blood had carried me unhurt across that
reeking and pestiferous morass; by mere good fortune, I had
escaped the crawling and stinging vermin with which it was alive;
and I had now before me the easier portion of my enterprise, to
cross the isle and to make good my arrival at the haven and my
acceptance on the English yacht.&nbsp; It was impossible by night
to follow such a track as my father had described; and I was
casting about for any landmark, and, in my ignorance, vainly
consulting the disposition of the stars, when there fell upon my
ear, from somewhere far in front, the sound of many voices
hurriedly singing.</p>
<p>I scarce knew upon what grounds I acted; but I shaped my steps
in the direction of that sound; and in a quarter of an
hour&rsquo;s walking, came unperceived to the margin of an open
glade.&nbsp; It was lighted by the strong moon and by the flames
of a fire.&nbsp; In the midst, there stood a little low and rude
building, surmounted by a cross: a chapel, as I then remembered
to have heard, long since desecrated and given over to the rites
of Hoodoo.&nbsp; Hard by the steps of entrance was a black mass,
continually agitated and stirring to and fro as if with
inarticulate life; and this I presently perceived to be a heap of
cocks, hares, dogs, and other birds and animals, still
struggling, but helplessly tethered and cruelly tossed one upon
another.&nbsp; Both the fire and the chapel were surrounded by a
ring of kneeling Africans, both men and women.&nbsp; Now they
would raise their palms half-closed to heaven, with a peculiar,
passionate gesture of supplication; now they would bow their
heads and spread their hands before them on the ground.&nbsp; As
the double movement passed and repassed along the line, the heads
kept rising and falling, like waves upon the sea; and still, as
if in time to these gesticulations, the hurried chant
continued.&nbsp; I stood spellbound, knowing that my life
depended by a hair, knowing that I had stumbled on a celebration
of the rites of Hoodoo.</p>
<p>Presently, the door of the chapel opened, and there came forth
a tall negro, entirely nude, and bearing in his hand the
sacrificial knife.&nbsp; He was followed by an apparition still
more strange and shocking: Madam Mendizabal, naked also, and
carrying in both hands and raised to the level of her face, an
open basket of wicker.&nbsp; It was filled with coiling snakes;
and these, as she stood there with the uplifted basket, shot
through the osier grating and curled about her arms.&nbsp; At the
sight of this, the fervour of the crowd seemed to swell suddenly
higher; and the chant rose in pitch and grew more irregular in
time and accent.&nbsp; Then, at a sign from the tall negro, where
he stood, motionless and smiling, in the moon and firelight, the
singing died away, and there began the second stage of this
barbarous and bloody celebration.&nbsp; From different parts of
the ring, one after another, man or woman, ran forth into the
midst; ducked, with that same gesture of the thrown-up hand,
before the priestess and her snakes; and with various
adjurations, uttered aloud the blackest wishes of the
heart.&nbsp; Death and disease were the favours usually invoked:
the death or the disease of enemies or rivals; some calling down
these plagues upon the nearest of their own blood, and one, to
whom I swear I had been never less than kind, invoking them upon
myself.&nbsp; At each petition, the tall negro, still smiling,
picked up some bird or animal from the heaving mass upon his
left, slew it with the knife, and tossed its body on the
ground.&nbsp; At length, it seemed, it reached the turn of the
high-priestess.&nbsp; She set down the basket on the steps, moved
into the centre of the ring, grovelled in the dust before the
reptiles, and still grovelling lifted up her voice, between
speech and singing, and with so great, with so insane a fervour
of excitement, as struck a sort of horror through my blood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Power,&rsquo; she began, &lsquo;whose name we do not
utter; power that is neither good nor evil, but below them both;
stronger than good, greater than evil&mdash;all my life long I
have adored and served thee.&nbsp; Who has shed blood upon thine
altars? whose voice is broken with the singing of thy praises?
whose limbs are faint before their age with leaping in thy
revels?&nbsp; Who has slain the child of her body?&nbsp;
I,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;I, Metamnbogu!&nbsp; By my own name,
I name myself.&nbsp; I tear away the veil.&nbsp; I would be
served or perish.&nbsp; Hear me, slime of the fat swamp,
blackness of the thunder, venom of the serpent&rsquo;s
udder&mdash;hear or slay me!&nbsp; I would have two things, O
shapeless one, O horror of emptiness&mdash;two things, or
die!&nbsp; The blood of my white-faced husband; oh! give me that;
he is the enemy of Hoodoo; give me his blood!&nbsp; And yet
another, O racer of the blind winds, O germinator in the ruins of
the dead, O root of life, root of corruption!&nbsp; I grow old, I
grow hideous; I am known, I am hunted for my life: let thy
servant then lay by this outworn body; let thy chief priestess
turn again to the blossom of her days, and be a girl once more,
and the desired of all men, even as in the past!&nbsp; And, O
lord and master, as I here ask a marvel not yet wrought since we
were torn from the old land, have I not prepared the sacrifice in
which thy soul delighteth&mdash;the kid without the
horns?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Even as she uttered the words, there was a great rumour of joy
through all the circle of worshippers; it rose, and fell, and
rose again; and swelled at last into rapture, when the tall
negro, who had stepped an instant into the chapel, reappeared
before the door, carrying in his arms the body of the slave-girl,
Cora.&nbsp; I know not if I saw what followed.&nbsp; When next my
mind awoke to a clear knowledge, Cora was laid upon the steps
before the serpents; the negro with the knife stood over her; the
knife rose; and at this I screamed out in my great horror,
bidding them, in God&rsquo;s name, to pause.</p>
<p>A stillness fell upon the mob of cannibals.&nbsp; A moment
more, and they must have thrown off this stupor, and I infallibly
have perished.&nbsp; But Heaven had designed to save me.&nbsp;
The silence of these wretched men was not yet broken, when there
arose, in the empty night, a sound louder than the roar of any
European tempest, swifter to travel than the wings of any Eastern
wind.&nbsp; Blackness engulfed the world; blackness, stabbed
across from every side by intricate and blinding lightning.&nbsp;
Almost in the same second, at one world-swallowing stride, the
heart of the tornado reached the clearing.&nbsp; I heard an
agonising crash, and the light of my reason was overwhelmed.</p>
<p>When I recovered consciousness, the day was come.&nbsp; I was
unhurt; the trees close about me had not lost a bough; and I
might have thought at first that the tornado was a feature in a
dream.&nbsp; It was otherwise indeed; for when I looked abroad, I
perceived I had escaped destruction by a
hand&rsquo;s-breadth.&nbsp; Right through the forest, which here
covered hill and dale, the storm had ploughed a lane of
ruin.&nbsp; On either hand, the trees waved uninjured in the air
of the morning; but in the forthright course of its advance, the
hurricane had left no trophy standing.&nbsp; Everything, in that
line, tree, man, or animal, the desecrated chapel and the
votaries of Hoodoo, had been subverted and destroyed in that
brief spasm of anger of the powers of air.&nbsp; Everything, but
a yard or two beyond the line of its passage, humble flower,
lofty tree, and the poor vulnerable maid who now knelt to pay her
gratitude to heaven, awoke unharmed in the crystal purity and
peace of the new day.</p>
<p>To move by the path of the tornado was a thing impossible to
man, so wildly were the wrecks of the tall forest piled together
by that fugitive convulsion.&nbsp; I crossed it indeed; with such
labour and patience, with so many dangerous slips and falls, as
left me, at the further side, bankrupt alike of strength and
courage.&nbsp; There I sat down awhile to recruit my forces; and
as I ate (how should I bless the kindliness of Heaven!) my eye,
flitting to and fro in the colonnade of the great trees, alighted
on a trunk that had been blazed.&nbsp; Yes, by the directing hand
of Providence, I had been conducted to the very track I was to
follow.&nbsp; With what a light heart I now set forth, and
walking with how glad a step, traversed the uplands of the
isle!</p>
<p>It was hard upon the hour of noon, when I came, all tattered
and wayworn, to the summit of a steep descent, and looked below
me on the sea.&nbsp; About all the coast, the surf, roused by the
tornado of the night, beat with a particular fury and made a
fringe of snow.&nbsp; Close at my feet, I saw a haven, set in
precipitous and palm-crowned bluffs of rock.&nbsp; Just outside,
a ship was heaving on the surge, so trimly sparred, so glossily
painted, so elegant and point-device in every feature, that my
heart was seized with admiration.&nbsp; The English colours blew
from her masthead; and from my high station, I caught glimpses of
her snowy planking, as she rolled on the uneven deep, and saw the
sun glitter on the brass of her deck furniture.&nbsp; There,
then, was my ship of refuge; and of all my difficulties only one
remained: to get on board of her.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, I issued at last out of the woods on the
margin of a cove, into whose jaws the tossing and blue billows
entered, and along whose shores they broke with a surprising
loudness.&nbsp; A wooded promontory hid the yacht; and I had
walked some distance round the beach, in what appeared to be a
virgin solitude, when my eye fell on a boat, drawn into a natural
harbour, where it rocked in safety, but deserted.&nbsp; I looked
about for those who should have manned her; and presently, in the
immediate entrance of the wood, spied the red embers of a fire,
and, stretched around in various attitudes, a party of slumbering
mariners.&nbsp; To these I drew near: most were black, a few
white; but all were dressed with the conspicuous decency of
yachtsmen; and one, from his peaked cap and glittering buttons, I
rightly divined to be an officer.&nbsp; Him, then, I touched upon
the shoulder.&nbsp; He started up; the sharpness of his movement
woke the rest; and they all stared upon me in surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; inquired the officer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To go on board the yacht,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>I thought they all seemed disconcerted at this; and the
officer, with something of sharpness, asked me who I was.&nbsp;
Now I had determined to conceal my name until I met Sir George;
and the first name that rose to my lips was that of the
Se&ntilde;ora Mendizabal.&nbsp; At the word, there went a shock
about the little party of seamen; the negroes stared at me with
indescribable eagerness, the whites themselves with something of
a scared surprise; and instantly the spirit of mischief prompted
me to add, &lsquo;And if the name is new to your ears, call me
Metamnbogu.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had never seen an effect so wonderful.&nbsp; The negroes
threw their hands into the air, with the same gesture I remarked
the night before about the Hoodoo camp-fire; first one, and then
another, ran forward and kneeled down and kissed the skirts of my
torn dress; and when the white officer broke out swearing and
calling to know if they were mad, the coloured seamen took him by
the shoulders, dragged him on one side till they were out of
hearing, and surrounded him with open mouths and extravagant
pantomime.&nbsp; The officer seemed to struggle hard; he laughed
aloud, and I saw him make gestures of dissent and protest; but in
the end, whether overcome by reason or simply weary of
resistance, he gave in&mdash;approached me civilly enough, but
with something of a sneering manner underneath&mdash;and touching
his cap, &lsquo;My lady,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;if that is what
you are, the boat is ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My reception on board the <i>Nemorosa</i> (for so the yacht
was named) partook of the same mingled nature.&nbsp; We were
scarcely within hail of that great and elegant fabric, where she
lay rolling gunwale under and churning the blue sea to snow,
before the bulwarks were lined with the heads of a great crowd of
seamen, black, white, and yellow; and these and the few who
manned the boat began exchanging shouts in some <i>lingua
franca</i> incomprehensible to me.&nbsp; All eyes were directed
on the passenger; and once more I saw the negroes toss up their
hands to heaven, but now as if with passionate wonder and
delight.</p>
<p>At the head of the gangway, I was received by another officer,
a gentlemanly man with blond and bushy whiskers; and to him I
addressed my demand to see Sir George.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But this is not&mdash;&rsquo; he cried, and paused.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know it,&rsquo; returned the other officer, who had
brought me from the shore.&nbsp; &lsquo;But what the devil can we
do?&nbsp; Look at all the niggers!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I followed his direction; and as my eye lighted upon each, the
poor ignorant Africans ducked, and bowed, and threw their hands
into the air, as though in the presence of a creature half
divine.&nbsp; Apparently the officer with the whiskers had
instantly come round to the opinion of his subaltern; for he now
addressed me with every signal of respect.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir George is at the island, my lady,&rsquo; said he:
&lsquo;for which, with your ladyship&rsquo;s permission, I shall
immediately make all sail.&nbsp; The cabins are prepared.&nbsp;
Steward, take Lady Greville below.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Under this new name, then, and so captivated by surprise that
I could neither think nor speak, I was ushered into a spacious
and airy cabin, hung about with weapons and surrounded by
divans.&nbsp; The steward asked for my commands; but I was by
this time so wearied, bewildered, and disturbed, that I could
only wave him to leave me to myself, and sink upon a pile of
cushions.&nbsp; Presently, by the changed motion of the ship, I
knew her to be under way; my thoughts, so far from clarifying,
grew the more distracted and confused; dreams began to mingle and
confound them; and at length, by insensible transition, I sank
into a dreamless slumber.</p>
<p>When I awoke, the day and night had passed, and it was once
more morning.&nbsp; The world on which I reopened my eyes swam
strangely up and down; the jewels in the bag that lay beside me
chinked together ceaselessly; the clock and the barometer wagged
to and fro like pendulums; and overhead, seamen were singing out
at their work, and coils of rope clattering and thumping on the
deck.&nbsp; Yet it was long before I had divined that I was at
sea; long before I had recalled, one after another, the tragical,
mysterious, and inexplicable events that had brought me where
was.</p>
<p>When I had done so, I thrust the jewels, which I was surprised
to find had been respected, into the bosom of my dress; and
seeing a silver bell hard by upon a table, rang it loudly.&nbsp;
The steward instantly appeared; I asked for food; and he
proceeded to lay the table, regarding me the while with a
disquieting and pertinacious scrutiny.&nbsp; To relieve myself of
my embarrassment, I asked him, with as fair a show of ease as I
could muster, if it were usual for yachts to carry so numerous a
crew?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I know not who you are,
nor what mad fancy has induced you to usurp a name and an
appalling destiny that are not yours.&nbsp; I warn you from the
soul.&nbsp; No sooner arrived at the island&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this moment he was interrupted by the whiskered officer,
who had entered unperceived behind him, and now laid a hand upon
his shoulder.&nbsp; The sudden pallor, the deadly and sick fear,
that was imprinted on the steward&rsquo;s face, formed a
startling addition to his words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Parker!&rsquo; said the officer, and pointed towards
the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Mr. Kentish,&rsquo; said the steward.&nbsp;
&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Mr. Kentish!&rsquo;&nbsp; And
vanished, with a white face, from the cabin.</p>
<p>Thereupon the officer bade me sit down, and began to help me,
and join in the meal.&nbsp; &lsquo;I fill your ladyship&rsquo;s
glass,&rsquo; said he, and handed me a tumbler of neat rum.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; cried I, &lsquo;do you expect me to drink
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laughed heartily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your ladyship is so much
changed,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that I no longer expect any one
thing more than any other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Immediately after, a white seaman entered the cabin, saluted
both Mr. Kentish and myself, and informed the officer there was a
sail in sight, which was bound to pass us very close, and that
Mr. Harland was in doubt about the colours.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Being so near the island?&rsquo; asked Mr. Kentish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was what Mr. Harland said, sir,&rsquo; returned
the sailor, with a scrape.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better not, I think,&rsquo; said Mr. Kentish.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My compliments to Mr. Harland; and if she seem a lively
boat, give her the stars and stripes; but if she be dull, and we
can easily outsail her, show John Dutchman.&nbsp; That is always
another word for incivility at sea; so we can disregard a hail or
a flag of distress, without attracting notice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the sailor had gone on deck, I turned to the
officer in wonder.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Kentish, if that be your
name,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;are you ashamed of your own
colours?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your ladyship refers to the <i>Jolly Roger</i>?&rsquo;
he inquired, with perfect gravity; and immediately after, went
into peals of laughter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo; said he;
&lsquo;but here for the first time I recognise your
ladyship&rsquo;s impetuosity.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nor, try as I pleased,
could I extract from him any explanation of this mystery, but
only oily and commonplace evasion.</p>
<p>While we were thus occupied, the movement of the
<i>Nemorosa</i> gradually became less violent; its speed at the
same time diminished; and presently after, with a sullen plunge,
the anchor was discharged into the sea.&nbsp; Kentish immediately
rose, offered his arm, and conducted me on deck; where I found we
were lying in a roadstead among many low and rocky islets,
hovered about by an innumerable cloud of sea-fowl.&nbsp;
Immediately under our board, a somewhat larger isle was green
with trees, set with a few low buildings and approached by a pier
of very crazy workmanship; and a little inshore of us, a smaller
vessel lay at anchor.</p>
<p>I had scarce time to glance to the four quarters, ere a boat
was lowered.&nbsp; I was handed in, Kentish took place beside me,
and we pulled briskly to the pier.&nbsp; A crowd of villainous,
armed loiterers, both black and white, looked on upon our
landing; and again the word passed about among the negroes, and
again I was received with prostrations and the same gesture of
the flung-up hand.&nbsp; By this, what with the appearance of
these men, and the lawless, sea-girt spot in which I found
myself, my courage began a little to decline, and clinging to the
arm of Mr. Kentish, I begged him to tell me what it meant?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, madam,&rsquo; he returned, &lsquo;<i>you</i>
know.&rsquo;&nbsp; And leading me smartly through the crowd,
which continued to follow at a considerable distance, and at
which he still kept looking back, I thought, with apprehension,
he brought me to a low house that stood alone in an encumbered
yard, opened the door, and begged me to enter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I demand to see
Sir George.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; returned Mr. Kentish, looking suddenly as
black as thunder, &lsquo;to drop all fence, I know neither who
nor what you are; beyond the fact that you are not the person
whose name you have assumed.&nbsp; But be what you please, spy,
ghost, devil, or most ill-judging jester, if you do not
immediately enter that house, I will cut you to the
earth.&rsquo;&nbsp; And even as he spoke, he threw an uneasy
glance behind him at the following crowd of blacks.</p>
<p>I did not wait to be twice threatened; I obeyed at once, and
with a palpitating heart; and the next moment, the door was
locked from the outside and the key withdrawn.&nbsp; The interior
was long, low, and quite unfurnished, but filled, almost from end
to end, with sugar-cane, tar-barrels, old tarry rope, and other
incongruous and highly inflammable material; and not only was the
door locked, but the solitary window barred with iron.</p>
<p>I was by this time so exceedingly bewildered and afraid, that
I would have given years of my life to be once more the slave of
Mr. Caulder.&nbsp; I still stood, with my hands clasped, the
image of despair, looking about me on the lumber of the room or
raising my eyes to heaven; when there appeared outside the window
bars, the face of a very black negro, who signed to me
imperiously to draw near.&nbsp; I did so, and he instantly, and
with every mark of fervour, addressed me a long speech in some
unknown and barbarous tongue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I declare,&rsquo; I cried, clasping my brow, &lsquo;I
do not understand one syllable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not?&rsquo; he said in Spanish.&nbsp; &lsquo;Great,
great, are the powers of Hoodoo!&nbsp; Her very mind is
changed!&nbsp; But, O chief priestess, why have you suffered
yourself to be shut into this cage? why did you not call your
slaves at once to your defence?&nbsp; Do you not see that all has
been prepared to murder you? at a spark, this flimsy house will
go in flames; and alas! who shall then be the chief priestess?
and what shall be the profit of the miracle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heavens!&rsquo; cried I, &lsquo;can I not see Sir
George?&nbsp; I must, I must, come by speech of him.&nbsp; Oh,
bring me to Sir George!&rsquo;&nbsp; And, my terror fairly
mastering my courage, I fell upon my knees and began to pray to
all the saints.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lordy!&rsquo; cried the negro, &lsquo;here they
come!&rsquo;&nbsp; And his black head was instantly withdrawn
from the window.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never heard such nonsense in my life,&rsquo;
exclaimed a voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, so we all say, Sir George,&rsquo; replied the
voice of Mr. Kentish.&nbsp; &lsquo;But put yourself in our
place.&nbsp; The niggers were near two to one.&nbsp; And upon my
word, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, sir, considering the notion they
have taken in their heads, I regard it as precious fortunate for
all of us that the mistake occurred.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is no question of fortune, sir,&rsquo; returned
Sir George.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a question of my orders, and you
may take my word for it, Kentish, either Harland, or yourself, or
Parker&mdash;or, by George, all three of you!&mdash;shall swing
for this affair.&nbsp; These are my sentiments.&nbsp; Give me the
key and be off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Immediately after, the key turned in the lock; and there
appeared upon the threshold a gentleman, between forty and fifty,
with a very open countenance, and of a stout and personable
figure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear young lady,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;who the
devil may you be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I told him all my story in one rush of words.&nbsp; He heard
me, from the first, with an amazement you can scarcely picture,
but when I came to the death of the Se&ntilde;ora Mendizabal in
the tornado, he fairly leaped into the air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear child,&rsquo; he cried, clasping me in his
arms, &lsquo;excuse a man who might be your father!&nbsp; This is
the best news I ever had since I was born; for that hag of a
mulatto was no less a person than my wife.&rsquo;&nbsp; He sat
down upon a tar-barrel, as if unmanned by joy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear
me,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I declare this tempts me to believe in
Providence.&nbsp; And what,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;can I do for
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir George,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I am already rich:
all that I ask is your protection.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Understand one thing,&rsquo; he said, with great
energy.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will never marry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had not ventured to propose it,&rsquo; I exclaimed,
unable to restrain my mirth; &lsquo;I only seek to be conveyed to
England, the natural home of the escaped slave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; returned Sir George, &lsquo;frankly I owe
you something for this exhilarating news; besides, your father
was of use to me.&nbsp; Now, I have made a small competence in
business&mdash;a jewel mine, a sort of naval agency, et
c&aelig;tera, and I am on the point of breaking up my company,
and retiring to my place in Devonshire to pass a plain old age,
unmarried.&nbsp; One good turn deserves another: if you swear to
hold your tongue about this island, these little bonfire
arrangements, and the whole episode of my unfortunate marriage,
why, I&rsquo;ll carry you home aboard the
<i>Nemorosa</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; I eagerly accepted his
conditions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One thing more,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;My late
wife was some sort of a sorceress among the blacks; and they are
all persuaded she has come alive again in your agreeable
person.&nbsp; Now, you will have the goodness to keep up that
fancy, if you please; and to swear to them, on the authority of
Hoodoo or whatever his name may be, that I am from this moment
quite a sacred character.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I swear it,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;by my father&rsquo;s
memory; and that is a vow that I will never break.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have considerably better hold on you than any
oath,&rsquo; returned Sir George, with a chuckle; &lsquo;for you
are not only an escaped slave, but have, by your own account, a
considerable amount of stolen property.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was struck dumb; I saw it was too true; in a glance, I
recognised that these jewels were no longer mine; with similar
quickness, I decided they should be restored, ay, if it cost me
the liberty that I had just regained.&nbsp; Forgetful of all
else, forgetful of Sir George, who sat and watched me with a
smile, I drew out Mr. Caulder&rsquo;s pocket-book and turned to
the page on which the dying man had scrawled his testament.&nbsp;
How shall I describe the agony of happiness and remorse with
which I read it! for my victim had not only set me free, but
bequeathed to me the bag of jewels.</p>
<p>My plain tale draws towards a close.&nbsp; Sir George and I,
in my character of his rejuvenated wife, displayed ourselves
arm-in-arm among the negroes, and were cheered and followed to
the place of embarkation.&nbsp; There, Sir George, turning about,
made a speech to his old companions, in which he thanked and bade
them farewell with a very manly spirit; and towards the end of
which he fell on some expressions which I still remember.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If any of you gentry lose your money,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;take care you do not come to me; for in the first place, I
shall do my best to have you murdered; and if that fails, I hand
you over to the law.&nbsp; Blackmail won&rsquo;t do for me.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll rather risk all upon a cast, than be pulled to pieces
by degrees.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll rather be found out and hang, than
give a doit to one man-jack of you.&rsquo;&nbsp; That same night
we got under way and crossed to the port of New Orleans, whence,
as a sacred trust, I sent the pocket-book to Mr. Caulder&rsquo;s
son.&nbsp; In a week&rsquo;s time, the men were all paid off; new
hands were shipped; and the <i>Nemorosa</i> weighed her anchor
for Old England.</p>
<p>A more delightful voyage it were hard to fancy.&nbsp; Sir
George, of course, was not a conscientious man; but he had an
unaffected gaiety of character that naturally endeared him to the
young; and it was interesting to hear him lay out his projects
for the future, when he should be returned to Parliament, and
place at the service of the nation his experience of marine
affairs.&nbsp; I asked him, if his notion of piracy upon a
private yacht were not original.&nbsp; But he told me, no.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A yacht, Miss Valdevia,&rsquo; he observed, &lsquo;is a
chartered nuisance.&nbsp; Who smuggles?&nbsp; Who robs the salmon
rivers of the West of Scotland?&nbsp; Who cruelly beats the
keepers if they dare to intervene?&nbsp; The crews and the
proprietors of yachts.&nbsp; All I have done is to extend the
line a trifle, and if you ask me for my unbiassed opinion, I do
not suppose that I am in the least alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In short, we were the best of friends, and lived like father
and daughter; though I still withheld from him, of course, that
respect which is only due to moral excellence.</p>
<p>We were still some days&rsquo; sail from England, when Sir
George obtained, from an outward-bound ship, a packet of
newspapers; and from that fatal hour my misfortunes
recommenced.&nbsp; He sat, the same evening, in the cabin,
reading the news, and making savoury comments on the decline of
England and the poor condition of the navy, when I suddenly
observed him to change countenance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hullo!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;this is bad; this is
deuced bad, Miss Valdevia.&nbsp; You would not listen to sound
sense, you would send that pocket-book to that man
Caulder&rsquo;s son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir George,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;it was my
duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are prettily paid for it, at least,&rsquo; says he;
&lsquo;and much as I regret it, I, for one, am done with
you.&nbsp; This fellow Caulder demands your
extradition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But a slave,&rsquo; I returned, &lsquo;is safe in
England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, by George!&rsquo; replied the baronet; &lsquo;but
it&rsquo;s not a slave, Miss Valdevia, it&rsquo;s a thief that he
demands.&nbsp; He has quietly destroyed the will; and now accuses
you of robbing your father&rsquo;s bankrupt estate of jewels to
the value of a hundred thousand pounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was so much overcome by indignation at this hateful charge
and concern for my unhappy fate that the genial baronet made
haste to put me more at ease.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not be cast down,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of
course, I wash my hands of you myself.&nbsp; A man in my
position&mdash;baronet, old family, and all that&mdash;cannot
possibly be too particular about the company he keeps.&nbsp; But
I am a deuced good-humoured old boy, let me tell you, when not
ruffled; and I will do the best I can to put you right.&nbsp; I
will lend you a trifle of ready money, give you the address of an
excellent lawyer in London, and find a way to set you on shore
unsuspected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was in every particular as good as his word.&nbsp; Four
days later, the <i>Nemorosa</i> sounded her way, under the cloak
of a dark night, into a certain haven of the coast of England;
and a boat, rowing with muffled oars, set me ashore upon the
beach within a stone&rsquo;s throw of a railway station.&nbsp;
Thither, guided by Sir George&rsquo;s directions, I groped a
devious way; and finding a bench upon the platform, sat me down,
wrapped in a man&rsquo;s fur great-coat, to await the coming of
the day.&nbsp; It was still dark when a light was struck behind
one of the windows of the building; nor had the east begun to
kindle to the warmer colours of the dawn, before a porter
carrying a lantern, issued from the door and found himself face
to face with the unfortunate Teresa.&nbsp; He looked all about
him; in the grey twilight of the dawn, the haven was seen to lie
deserted, and the yacht had long since disappeared.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am a traveller,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And where do you come from?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going by the first train to London,&rsquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>In such manner, like a ghost or a new creation, was Teresa
with her bag of jewels landed on the shores of England; in this
silent fashion, without history or name, she took her place among
the millions of a new country.</p>
<p>Since then, I have lived by the expedients of my lawyer, lying
concealed in quiet lodgings, dogged by the spies of Cuba, and not
knowing at what hour my liberty and honour may be lost.</p>
<h2><!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span><i>THE BROWN BOX</i><br />
(<i>Concluded</i>)</h2>
<p>The effect of this tale on the mind of Harry Desborough was
instant and convincing.&nbsp; The Fair Cuban had been already the
loveliest, she now became, in his eyes, the most romantic, the
most innocent, and the most unhappy of her sex.&nbsp; He was
bereft of words to utter what he felt: what pity, what
admiration, what youthful envy of a career so vivid and
adventurous.&nbsp; &lsquo;O madam!&rsquo; he began; and finding
no language adequate to that apostrophe, caught up her hand and
wrung it in his own.&nbsp; &lsquo;Count upon me,&rsquo; he added,
with bewildered fervour; and getting somehow or other out of the
apartment and from the circle of that radiant sorceress, he found
himself in the strange out-of-doors, beholding dull houses,
wondering at dull passers-by, a fallen angel.&nbsp; She had
smiled upon him as he left, and with how significant, how
beautiful a smile!&nbsp; The memory lingered in his heart; and
when he found his way to a certain restaurant where music was
performed, flutes (as it were of Paradise) accompanied his
meal.&nbsp; The strings went to the melody of that parting smile;
they paraphrased and glossed it in the sense that he desired; and
for the first time in his plain and somewhat dreary life, he
perceived himself to have a taste for music.</p>
<p>The next day, and the next, his meditations moved to that
delectable air.&nbsp; Now he saw her, and was favoured; now saw
her not at all; now saw her and was put by.&nbsp; The fall of her
foot upon the stair entranced him; the books that he sought out
and read were books on Cuba, and spoke of her indirectly; nay,
and in the very landlady&rsquo;s parlour, he found one that told
of precisely such a hurricane, and, down to the smallest detail,
confirmed (had confirmation been required) the truth of her
recital.&nbsp; Presently he began to fall into that prettiest
mood of a young love, in which the lover scorns himself for his
presumption.&nbsp; Who was he, the dull one, the commonplace
unemployed, the man without adventure, the impure, the
untruthful, to aspire to such a creature made of fire and air,
and hallowed and adorned by such incomparable passages of
life?&nbsp; What should he do, to be more worthy? by what
devotion, call down the notice of these eyes to so terrene a
being as himself?</p>
<p>He betook himself, thereupon, to the rural privacy of the
square, where, being a lad of a kind heart, he had made himself a
circle of acquaintances among its shy frequenters, the
half-domestic cats and the visitors that hung before the windows
of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital.&nbsp; There he walked,
considering the depth of his demerit and the height of the adored
one&rsquo;s super-excellence; now lighting upon earth to say a
pleasant word to the brother of some infant invalid; now, with a
great heave of breath, remembering the queen of women, and the
sunshine of his life.</p>
<p>What was he to do?&nbsp; Teresa, he had observed, was in the
habit of leaving the house towards afternoon: she might,
perchance, run danger from some Cuban emissary, when the presence
of a friend might turn the balance in her favour: how, then, if
he should follow her?&nbsp; To offer his company would seem like
an intrusion; to dog her openly were a manifest impertinence; he
saw himself reduced to a more stealthy part, which, though in
some ways distasteful to his mind, he did not doubt that he could
practise with the skill of a detective.</p>
<p>The next day he proceeded to put his plan in action.&nbsp; At
the corner of Tottenham Court Road, however, the Se&ntilde;orita
suddenly turned back, and met him face to face, with every mark
of pleasure and surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Se&ntilde;or, I am sometimes fortunate!&rsquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was looking for a messenger;&rsquo; and
with the sweetest of smiles, she despatched him to the East End
of London, to an address which he was unable to find.&nbsp; This
was a bitter pill to the knight-errant; but when he returned at
night, worn out with fruitless wandering and dismayed by his
<i>fiasco</i>, the lady received him with a friendly gaiety,
protesting that all was for the best, since she had changed her
mind and long since repented of her message.</p>
<p>Next day he resumed his labours, glowing with pity and
courage, and determined to protect Teresa with his life.&nbsp;
But a painful shock awaited him.&nbsp; In the narrow and silent
Hanway Street, she turned suddenly about and addressed him with a
manner and a light in her eyes that were new to the young
man&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do I understand that you follow me,
Se&ntilde;or?&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are these the
manners of the English gentleman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harry confounded himself in the most abject apologies and
prayers to be forgiven, vowed to offend no more, and was at
length dismissed, crestfallen and heavy of heart.&nbsp; The check
was final; he gave up that road to service; and began once more
to hang about the square or on the terrace, filled with remorse
and love, admirable and idiotic, a fit object for the scorn and
envy of older men.&nbsp; In these idle hours, while he was
courting fortune for a sight of the beloved, it fell out
naturally that he should observe the manners and appearance of
such as came about the house.&nbsp; One person alone was the
occasional visitor of the young lady: a man of considerable
stature, and distinguished only by the doubtful ornament of a
chin-beard in the style of an American deacon.&nbsp; Something in
his appearance grated upon Harry; this distaste grew upon him in
the course of days; and when at length he mustered courage to
inquire of the Fair Cuban who this was, he was yet more dismayed
by her reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That gentleman,&rsquo; said she, a smile struggling to
her face, &lsquo;that gentleman, I will not attempt to conceal
from you, desires my hand in marriage, and presses me with the
most respectful ardour.&nbsp; Alas, what am I to say?&nbsp; I,
the forlorn Teresa, how shall I refuse or accept such
protestations?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harry feared to say more; a horrid pang of jealousy transfixed
him; and he had scarce the strength of mind to take his leave
with decency.&nbsp; In the solitude of his own chamber, he gave
way to every manifestation of despair.&nbsp; He passionately
adored the Se&ntilde;orita; but it was not only the thought of
her possible union with another that distressed his soul, it was
the indefeasible conviction that her suitor was unworthy.&nbsp;
To a duke, a bishop, a victorious general, or any man adorned
with obvious qualities, he had resigned her with a sort of bitter
joy; he saw himself follow the wedding party from a great way
off; he saw himself return to the poor house, then robbed of its
jewel; and while he could have wept for his despair, he felt he
could support it nobly.&nbsp; But this affair looked
otherwise.&nbsp; The man was patently no gentleman; he had a
startled, skulking, guilty bearing; his nails were black, his
eyes evasive; his love perhaps was a pretext; he was perhaps,
under this deep disguise, a Cuban emissary!</p>
<p>Harry swore that he would satisfy these doubts; and the next
evening, about the hour of the usual visit, he posted himself at
a spot whence his eye commanded the three issues of the
square.</p>
<p>Presently after, a four-wheeler rumbled to the door, and the
man with the chin-beard alighted, paid off the cabman, and was
seen by Harry to enter the house with a brown box hoisted on his
back.&nbsp; Half an hour later, he came forth again without the
box, and struck eastward at a rapid walk; and Desborough, with
the same skill and caution that he had displayed in following
Teresa, proceeded to dog the steps of her admirer.&nbsp; The man
began to loiter, studying with apparent interest the wares of the
small fruiterer or tobacconist; twice he returned hurriedly upon
his former course; and then, as though he had suddenly conquered
a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, once more set forth with resolute
and swift steps in the direction of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp; At
length, in a deserted by-street, he turned; and coming up to
Harry with a countenance which seemed to have become older and
whiter, inquired with some severity of speech if he had not had
the pleasure of seeing the gentleman before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have, sir,&rsquo; said Harry, somewhat abashed, but
with a good show of stoutness; &lsquo;and I will not deny that I
was following you on purpose.&nbsp; Doubtless,&rsquo; he added,
for he supposed that all men&rsquo;s minds must still be running
on Teresa, &lsquo;you can divine my reason.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At these words, the man with the chin-beard was seized with a
palsied tremor.&nbsp; He seemed, for some seconds, to seek the
utterance which his fear denied him; and then whipping sharply
about, he took to his heels at the most furious speed of
running.</p>
<p>Harry was at first so taken aback that he neglected to pursue;
and by the time he had recovered his wits, his best expedition
was only rewarded by a glimpse of the man with the chin-beard
mounting into a hansom, which immediately after disappeared into
the moving crowds of Holborn.</p>
<p>Puzzled and dismayed by this unusual behaviour, Harry returned
to the house in Queen Square, and ventured for the first time to
knock at the fair Cuban&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; She bade him enter,
and he found her kneeling with rather a disconsolate air beside a
brown wooden trunk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Se&ntilde;orita,&rsquo; he broke out, &lsquo;I doubt
whether that man&rsquo;s character is what he wishes you to
believe.&nbsp; His manner, when he found, and indeed when I
admitted that I was following him, was not the manner of an
honest man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she cried, throwing up her hands as in
desperation, &lsquo;Don Quixote, Don Quixote, have you again been
tilting against windmills?&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, with a laugh,
&lsquo;Poor soul!&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;how you must have
terrified him!&nbsp; For know that the Cuban authorities are
here, and your poor Teresa may soon be hunted down.&nbsp; Even
yon humble clerk from my solicitor&rsquo;s office may find
himself at any moment the quarry of armed spies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A humble clerk!&rsquo; cried Harry, &lsquo;why, you
told me yourself that he wished to marry you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you English like what you call a joke,&rsquo;
replied the lady calmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;As a matter of fact, he is
my lawyer&rsquo;s clerk, and has been here to-night charged with
disastrous news.&nbsp; I am in sore straits, Se&ntilde;or
Harry.&nbsp; Will you help me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this most welcome word, the young man&rsquo;s heart
exulted; and in the hope, pride, and self-esteem that kindled
with the very thought of service, he forgot to dwell upon the
lady&rsquo;s jest.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can you ask?&rsquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is there that I can do?&nbsp; Only tell
me that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With signs of an emotion that was certainly unfeigned, the
fair Cuban laid her hand upon the box.&nbsp; &lsquo;This
box,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;contains my jewels, papers, and
clothes; all, in a word, that still connects me with Cuba and my
dreadful past.&nbsp; They must now be smuggled out of England;
or, by the opinion of my lawyer, I am lost beyond remedy.&nbsp;
To-morrow, on board the Irish packet, a sure hand awaits the box:
the problem still unsolved, is to find some one to carry it as
far as Holyhead, to see it placed on board the steamer, and
instantly return to town.&nbsp; Will you be he?&nbsp; Will you
leave to-morrow by the first train, punctually obey orders, bear
still in mind that you are surrounded by Cuban spies; and without
so much as a look behind you, or a single movement to betray your
interest, leave the box where you have put it and come straight
on shore? Will you do this, and so save your friend?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not clearly understand . . .&rsquo; began
Harry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No more do I,&rsquo; replied the Cuban.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is not necessary that we should, so long as we obey the
lawyer&rsquo;s orders.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Se&ntilde;orita,&rsquo; returned Harry gravely,
&lsquo;I think this, of course, a very little thing to do for
you, when I would willingly do all.&nbsp; But suffer me to say
one word.&nbsp; If London is unsafe for your treasures, it cannot
long be safe for you; and indeed, if I at all fathom the plan of
your solicitor, I fear I may find you already fled on my
return.&nbsp; I am not considered clever, and can only speak out
plainly what is in my heart: that I love you, and that I cannot
bear to lose all knowledge of you.&nbsp; I hope no more than to
be your servant; I ask no more than just that I shall hear of
you.&nbsp; Oh, promise me so much!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shall,&rsquo; she said, after a pause.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I promise you, you shall.&rsquo;&nbsp; But though she
spoke with earnestness, the marks of great embarrassment and a
strong conflict of emotions appeared upon her face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish to tell you,&rsquo; resumed Desborough,
&lsquo;in case of accidents. . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Accidents!&rsquo; she cried: &lsquo;why do you say
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you may be gone
before my return, and we may not meet again for long.&nbsp; And
so I wished you to know this: That since the day you gave me the
cigarette, you have never once, not once, been absent from my
mind; and if it will in any way serve you, you may crumple me up
like that piece of paper, and throw me on the fire.&nbsp; I would
love to die for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go now at once.&nbsp;
My brain is in a whirl.&nbsp; I scarce know what we are
talking.&nbsp; Go; and good-night; and oh, may you come
safe!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Once back in his own room a fearful joy possessed the young
man&rsquo;s mind; and as he recalled her face struck suddenly
white and the broken utterance of her last words, his heart at
once exulted and misgave him.&nbsp; Love had indeed looked upon
him with a tragic mask; and yet what mattered, since at least it
was love&mdash;since at least she was commoved at their
division?&nbsp; He got to bed with these parti-coloured thoughts;
passed from one dream to another all night long, the white face
of Teresa still haunting him, wrung with unspoken thoughts; and
in the grey of the dawn, leaped suddenly out of bed, in a kind of
horror.&nbsp; It was already time for him to rise.&nbsp; He
dressed, made his breakfast on cold food that had been laid for
him the night before; and went down to the room of his idol for
the box.&nbsp; The door was open; a strange disorder reigned
within; the furniture all pushed aside, and the centre of the
room left bare of impediment, as though for the pacing of a
creature with a tortured mind.&nbsp; There lay the box, however,
and upon the lid a paper with these words: &lsquo;Harry, I hope
to be back before you go.&nbsp; Teresa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He sat down to wait, laying his watch before him on the
table.&nbsp; She had called him Harry: that should be enough, he
thought, to fill the day with sunshine; and yet somehow the sight
of that disordered room still poisoned his enjoyment.&nbsp; The
door of the bed-chamber stood gaping open; and though he turned
aside his eyes as from a sacrilege, he could not but observe the
bed had not been slept in.&nbsp; He was still pondering what this
should mean, still trying to convince himself that all was well,
when the moving needle of his watch summoned him to set forth
without delay.&nbsp; He was before all things a man of his word;
ran round to Southampton Row to fetch a cab; and taking the box
on the front seat, drove off towards the terminus.</p>
<p>The streets were scarcely awake; there was little to amuse the
eye; and the young man&rsquo;s attention centred on the dumb
companion of his drive.&nbsp; A card was nailed upon one side,
bearing the superscription: &lsquo;Miss Doolan, passenger to
Dublin.&nbsp; Glass.&nbsp; With care.&rsquo;&nbsp; He thought
with a sentimental shock that the fair idol of his heart was
perhaps driven to adopt the name of Doolan; and as he still
studied the card, he was aware of a deadly, black depression
settling steadily upon his spirits.&nbsp; It was in vain for him
to contend against the tide; in vain that he shook himself or
tried to whistle: the sense of some impending blow was not to be
averted.&nbsp; He looked out; in the long, empty streets, the cab
pursued its way without a trace of any follower.&nbsp; He gave
ear; and over and above the jolting of the wheels upon the road,
he was conscious of a certain regular and quiet sound that seemed
to issue from the box.&nbsp; He put his ear to the cover; at one
moment, he seemed to perceive a delicate ticking: the next, the
sound was gone, nor could his closest hearkening recapture
it.&nbsp; He laughed at himself; but still the gloom continued;
and it was with more than the common relief of an arrival, that
he leaped from the cab before the station.</p>
<p>Probably enough on purpose, Teresa had named an hour some
thirty minutes earlier than needful; and when Harry had given the
box into the charge of a porter, who sat it on a truck, he
proceeded briskly to pace the platform.&nbsp; Presently the
bookstall opened; and the young man was looking at the books when
he was seized by the arm.&nbsp; He turned, and, though she was
closely veiled, at once recognised the Fair Cuban.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is it?&rsquo; she asked; and the sound of her
voice surprised him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The box.&nbsp; Have it put on a cab instantly.&nbsp; I
am in fearful haste.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He hurried to obey, marvelling at these changes, but not
daring to trouble her with questions; and when the cab had been
brought round, and the box mounted on the front, she passed a
little way off upon the pavement and beckoned him to follow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said she, still in those mechanical and
hushed tones that had at first affected him, &lsquo;you must go
on to Holyhead alone; go on board the steamer; and if you see a
man in tartan trousers and a pink scarf, say to him that all has
been put off: if not,&rsquo; she added, with a sobbing sigh,
&lsquo;it does not matter.&nbsp; So, good-bye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Teresa,&rsquo; said Harry, &lsquo;get into your cab,
and I will go along with you.&nbsp; You are in some distress,
perhaps some danger; and till I know the whole, not even you can
make me leave you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will not?&rsquo; she asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;O Harry,
it were better!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not,&rsquo; said Harry stoutly.</p>
<p>She looked at him for a moment through her veil; took his hand
suddenly and sharply, but more as if in fear than tenderness; and
still holding him, walked to the cab-door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are we to drive?&rsquo; asked Harry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Home, quickly,&rsquo; she answered; &lsquo;double
fare!&rsquo;&nbsp; And as soon as they had both mounted to their
places, the vehicle crazily trundled from the station.</p>
<p>Teresa leaned back in a corner.&nbsp; The whole way Harry
could perceive her tears to flow under her veil; but she
vouchsafed no explanation.&nbsp; At the door of the house in
Queen Square, both alighted; and the cabman lowered the box,
which Harry, glad to display his strength, received upon his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let the man take it,&rsquo; she whispered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Let the man take it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will do no such thing,&rsquo; said Harry cheerfully;
and having paid the fare, he followed Teresa through the door
which she had opened with her key.&nbsp; The landlady and maid
were gone upon their morning errands; the house was empty and
still; and as the rattling of the cab died away down Gloucester
Street, and Harry continued to ascend the stair with his burthen,
he heard close against his shoulders the same faint and muffled
ticking as before.&nbsp; The lady, still preceding him, opened
the door of her room, and helped him to lower the box tenderly in
the corner by the window.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said Harry, &lsquo;what is
wrong?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will not go away?&rsquo; she cried, with a sudden
break in her voice and beating her hands together in the very
agony of impatience.&nbsp; &lsquo;O Harry, Harry, go away!&nbsp;
Oh, go, and leave me to the fate that I deserve!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fate?&rsquo; repeated Harry.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No fate,&rsquo; she resumed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not know
what I am saying.&nbsp; But I wish to be alone.&nbsp; You may
come back this evening, Harry; come again when you like; but
leave me now, only leave me now!&rsquo;&nbsp; And then suddenly,
&lsquo;I have an errand,&rsquo; she exclaimed; &lsquo;you cannot
refuse me that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Harry, &lsquo;you have no
errand.&nbsp; You are in grief or danger.&nbsp; Lift your veil
and tell me what it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; she said, with a sudden composure,
&lsquo;you leave but one course open to me.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
raising the veil, she showed him a countenance from which every
trace of colour had fled, eyes marred with weeping, and a brow on
which resolve had conquered fear.&nbsp; &lsquo;Harry,&rsquo; she
began, &lsquo;I am not what I seem.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have told me that before,&rsquo; said Harry,
&lsquo;several times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Harry, Harry,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;how you shame
me!&nbsp; But this is the God&rsquo;s truth.&nbsp; I am a
dangerous and wicked girl.&nbsp; My name is Clara Luxmore.&nbsp;
I was never nearer Cuba than Penzance.&nbsp; From first to last I
have cheated and played with you.&nbsp; And what I am I dare not
even name to you in words.&nbsp; Indeed, until to-day, until the
sleepless watches of last night, I never grasped the depth and
foulness of my guilt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young man looked upon her aghast.&nbsp; Then a generous
current poured along his veins.&nbsp; &lsquo;That is all
one,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you be all you say, you have
the greater need of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it possible,&rsquo; she exclaimed, &lsquo;that I
have schemed in vain?&nbsp; And will nothing drive you from this
house of death?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of death?&rsquo; he echoed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Death!&rsquo; she cried: &lsquo;death!&nbsp; In that
box that you have dragged about London and carried on your
defenceless shoulders, sleep, at the trigger&rsquo;s mercy, the
destroying energies of dynamite.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My God!&rsquo; cried Harry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; she continued wildly, &lsquo;will you flee
now?&nbsp; At any moment you may hear the click that sounds the
ruin of this building.&nbsp; I was sure M&rsquo;Guire was wrong;
this morning, before day, I flew to Zero; he confirmed my fears;
I beheld you, my beloved Harry, fall a victim to my own
contrivances.&nbsp; I knew then I loved you&mdash;Harry, will you
go now?&nbsp; Will you not spare me this unwilling
crime?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harry remained speechless, his eyes fixed upon the box: at
last he turned to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it,&rsquo; he asked hoarsely, &lsquo;an infernal
machine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her lips formed the word &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; which her voice
refused to utter.</p>
<p>With fearful curiosity, he drew near and bent above the box;
in that still chamber, the ticking was distinctly audible; and at
the measured sound, the blood flowed back upon his heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For whom?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What matters it,&rsquo; she cried, seizing him by the
arm.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you may still be saved, what matter
questions?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God in heaven!&rsquo; cried Harry.&nbsp; &lsquo;And the
Children&rsquo;s Hospital!&nbsp; At whatever cost, this damned
contrivance must be stopped!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It cannot,&rsquo; she gasped.&nbsp; &lsquo;The power of
man cannot avert the blow.&nbsp; But you, Harry&mdash;you, my
beloved&mdash;you may still&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then from the box that lay so quietly in the corner, a
sudden catch was audible, like the catch of a clock before it
strikes the hour.&nbsp; For one second the two stared at each
other with lifted brows and stony eyes.&nbsp; Then Harry,
throwing one arm over his face, with the other clutched the girl
to his breast and staggered against the wall.</p>
<p>A dull and startling thud resounded through the room; their
eyes blinked against the coming horror; and still clinging
together like drowning people, they fell to the floor.&nbsp; Then
followed a prolonged and strident hissing as from the indignant
pit; an offensive stench seized them by the throat; the room was
filled with dense and choking fumes.</p>
<p>Presently these began a little to disperse: and when at length
they drew themselves, all limp and shaken, to a sitting posture,
the first object that greeted their vision was the box reposing
uninjured in its corner, but still leaking little wreaths of
vapour round the lid.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, poor Zero!&rsquo; cried the girl, with a strange
sobbing laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Alas, poor Zero!&nbsp; This will
break his heart!&rsquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span><i>THE SUPERFLUOUS MANSION</i><br />
(<i>Concluded</i>)</h2>
<p>Somerset ran straight upstairs; the door of the drawing-room,
contrary to all custom, was unlocked; and bursting in, the young
man found Zero seated on a sofa in an attitude of singular
dejection.&nbsp; Close beside him stood an untasted grog, the
mark of strong preoccupation.&nbsp; The room besides was in
confusion: boxes had been tumbled to and fro; the floor was
strewn with keys and other implements; and in the midst of this
disorder lay a lady&rsquo;s glove.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have come,&rsquo; cried Somerset, &lsquo;to make an
end of this.&nbsp; Either you will instantly abandon all your
schemes, or (cost what it may) I will denounce you to the
police.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; replied Zero, slowly shaking his head.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are too late, dear fellow!&nbsp; I am already at the
end of all my hopes, and fallen to be a laughing-stock and
mockery.&nbsp; My reading,&rsquo; he added, with a gentle
despondency of manner, &lsquo;has not been much among romances;
yet I recall from one a phrase that depicts my present state with
critical exactitude; and you behold me sitting here &ldquo;like a
burst drum.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What has befallen you?&rsquo; cried Somerset.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My last batch,&rsquo; returned the plotter wearily,
&lsquo;like all the others, is a hollow mockery and a
fraud.&nbsp; In vain do I combine the elements; in vain adjust
the springs; and I have now arrived at such a pitch of
disconsideration that (except yourself, dear fellow) I do not
know a soul that I can face.&nbsp; My subordinates themselves
have turned upon me.&nbsp; What language have I heard to-day,
what illiberality of sentiment, what pungency of
expression!&nbsp; She came once; I could have pardoned that, for
she was moved; but she returned, returned to announce to me this
crushing blow; and, Somerset, she was very inhumane.&nbsp; Yes,
dear fellow, I have drunk a bitter cup; the speech of females is
remarkable for . . . well, well!&nbsp; Denounce me, if you will;
you but denounce the dead.&nbsp; I am extinct.&nbsp; It is
strange how, at this supreme crisis of my life, I should be
haunted by quotations from works of an inexact and even fanciful
description; but here,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;is another:
&ldquo;Othello&rsquo;s occupation&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes,
dear Somerset, it is gone; I am no more a dynamiter; and how, I
ask you, after having tasted of these joys, am I to condescend to
a less glorious life?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot describe how you relieve me,&rsquo; returned
Somerset, sitting down on one of several boxes that had been
drawn out into the middle of the floor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had
conceived a sort of maudlin toleration for your character; I have
a great distaste, besides, for anything in the nature of a duty;
and upon both grounds, your news delights me.&nbsp; But I seem to
perceive,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;a certain sound of ticking in
this box.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Zero, with the same slow weariness
of manner, &lsquo;I have set several of them going.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My God!&rsquo; cried Somerset, bounding to his
feet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Machines?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Machines!&rsquo; returned the plotter bitterly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Machines indeed!&nbsp; I blush to be their author.&nbsp;
Alas!&rsquo; he said, burying his face in his hands, &lsquo;that
I should live to say it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madman!&rsquo; cried Somerset, shaking him by the
arm.&nbsp; &lsquo;What am I to understand?&nbsp; Have you,
indeed, set these diabolical contrivances in motion? and do we
stay here to be blown up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hoist with his own petard?&rdquo;&rsquo;
returned the plotter musingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;One more quotation:
strange!&nbsp; But indeed my brain is struck with numbness.&nbsp;
Yes, dear boy, I have, as you say, put my contrivance in
motion.&nbsp; The one on which you are sitting, I have timed for
half an hour.&nbsp; Yon other&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Half an hour!&mdash;&rsquo; echoed Somerset, dancing
with trepidation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Merciful Heavens, in half an
hour?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear fellow, why so much excitement?&rsquo; inquired
Zero.&nbsp; &lsquo;My dynamite is not more dangerous than toffy;
had I an only child, I would give it him to play with.&nbsp; You
see this brick?&rsquo; he continued, lifting a cake of the
infernal compound from the laboratory-table.&nbsp; &lsquo;At a
touch it should explode, and that with such unconquerable energy
as should bestrew the square with ruins.&nbsp; Well now,
behold!&nbsp; I dash it on the floor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somerset sprang forward, and with the strength of the very
ecstasy of terror, wrested the brick from his possession.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Heavens!&rsquo; he cried, wiping his brow; and then with
more care than ever mother handled her first-born withal,
gingerly transported the explosive to the far end of the
apartment: the plotter, his arms once more fallen to his side,
dispiritedly watching him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was entirely harmless,&rsquo; he sighed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They describe it as burning like tobacco.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the name of fortune,&rsquo; cried Somerset,
&lsquo;what have I done to you, or what have you done to
yourself, that you should persist in this insane behaviour?&nbsp;
If not for your own sake, then for mine, let us depart from this
doomed house, where I profess I have not the heart to leave you;
and then, if you will take my advice, and if your determination
be sincere, you will instantly quit this city, where no further
occupation can detain you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such, dear fellow, was my own design,&rsquo; replied
the plotter.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have, as you observe, no further
business here; and once I have packed a little bag, I shall ask
you to share a frugal meal, to go with me as far as to the
station, and see the last of a broken-hearted man.&nbsp; And
yet,&rsquo; he added, looking on the boxes with a lingering
regret, &lsquo;I should have liked to make quite certain.&nbsp; I
cannot but suspect my underlings of some mismanagement; it may be
fond, but yet I cherish that idea: it may be the weakness of a
man of science, but yet,&rsquo; he cried, rising into some
energy, &lsquo;I will never, I cannot if I try, believe that my
poor dynamite has had fair usage!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Five minutes!&rsquo; said Somerset, glancing with
horror at the timepiece.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you do not instantly
buckle to your bag, I leave you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A few necessaries,&rsquo; returned Zero, &lsquo;only a
few necessaries, dear Somerset, and you behold me
ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He passed into the bedroom, and after an interval which seemed
to draw out into eternity for his unfortunate companion, he
returned, bearing in his hand an open Gladstone bag.&nbsp; His
movements were still horribly deliberate, and his eyes lingered
gloatingly on his dear boxes, as he moved to and fro about the
drawing-room, gathering a few small trifles.&nbsp; Last of all,
he lifted one of the squares of dynamite.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Put that down!&rsquo; cried Somerset.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
what you say be true, you have no call to load yourself with that
ungodly contraband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Merely a curiosity, dear boy,&rsquo; he said
persuasively, and slipped the brick into his bag; &lsquo;merely a
memento of the past&mdash;ah, happy past, bright past!&nbsp; You
will not take a touch of spirits? no?&nbsp; I find you very
abstemious.&nbsp; Well,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;if you have
really no curiosity to await the event&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I!&rsquo; cried Somerset.&nbsp; &lsquo;My blood boils
to get away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said Zero, &lsquo;I am ready; I
would I could say, willing; but thus to leave the scene of my
sublime endeavours&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Without further parley, Somerset seized him by the arm, and
dragged him downstairs; the hall-door shut with a clang on the
deserted mansion; and still towing his laggardly companion, the
young man sped across the square in the Oxford Street
direction.&nbsp; They had not yet passed the corner of the
garden, when they were arrested by a dull thud of an
extraordinary amplitude of sound, accompanied and followed by a
shattering <i>fracas</i>.&nbsp; Somerset turned in time to see
the mansion rend in twain, vomit forth flames and smoke, and
instantly collapse into its cellars.&nbsp; At the same moment, he
was thrown violently to the ground.&nbsp; His first glance was
towards Zero.&nbsp; The plotter had but reeled against the garden
rail; he stood there, the Gladstone bag clasped tight upon his
heart, his whole face radiant with relief and gratitude; and the
young man heard him murmur to himself: &lsquo;<i>Nunc
dimittis</i>, <i>nunc dimittis</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The consternation of the populace was indescribable; the whole
of Golden Square was alive with men, women, and children, running
wildly to and fro, and like rabbits in a warren, dashing in and
out of the house doors.&nbsp; And under favour of this confusion,
Somerset dragged away the lingering plotter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was grand,&rsquo; he continued to murmur: &lsquo;it
was indescribably grand.&nbsp; Ah, green Erin, green Erin, what a
day of glory! and oh, my calumniated dynamite, how triumphantly
hast thou prevailed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly a shade crossed his face; and pausing in the middle
of the footway, he consulted the dial of his watch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good God!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;how mortifying! seven
minutes too early!&nbsp; The dynamite surpassed my hopes; but the
clockwork, fickle clockwork, has once more betrayed me.&nbsp;
Alas, can there be no success unmixed with failure? and must even
this red-letter day be chequered by a shadow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Incomparable ass!&rsquo; said Somerset, &lsquo;what
have you done?&nbsp; Blown up the house of an unoffending old
lady, and the whole earthly property of the only person who is
fool enough to befriend you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not understand these matters,&rsquo; replied
Zero, with an air of great dignity.&nbsp; &lsquo;This will shake
England to the heart.&nbsp; Gladstone, the truculent old man,
will quail before the pointing finger of revenge.&nbsp; And now
that my dynamite is proved effective&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heavens, you remind me!&rsquo; ejaculated
Somerset.&nbsp; &lsquo;That brick in your bag must be instantly
disposed of.&nbsp; But how?&nbsp; If we could throw it in the
river&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A torpedo,&rsquo; cried Zero, brightening, &lsquo;a
torpedo in the Thames!&nbsp; Superb, dear fellow!&nbsp; I
recognise in you the marks of an accomplished anarch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True!&rsquo; returned Somerset.&nbsp; &lsquo;It cannot
so be done; and there is no help but you must carry it away with
you.&nbsp; Come on, then, and let me at once consign you to a
train.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, nay, dear boy,&rsquo; protested Zero.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is now no call for me to leave.&nbsp; My character
is now reinstated; my fame brightens; this is the best thing I
have done yet; and I see from here the ovations that await the
author of the Golden Square Atrocity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My young friend,&rsquo; returned the other, &lsquo;I
give you your choice.&nbsp; I will either see you safe on board a
train or safe in gaol.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Somerset, this is unlike you!&rsquo; said the
chymist.&nbsp; &lsquo;You surprise me, Somerset.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall considerably more surprise you at the next
police office,&rsquo; returned Somerset, with something bordering
on rage.&nbsp; &lsquo;For on one point my mind is settled: either
I see you packed off to America, brick and all, or else you dine
in prison.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have perhaps neglected one point,&rsquo; returned
the unoffended Zero: &lsquo;for, speaking as a philosopher, I
fail to see what means you can employ to force me.&nbsp; The
will, my dear fellow&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, see here,&rsquo; interrupted Somerset.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are ignorant of anything but science, which I can
never regard as being truly knowledge; I, sir, have studied life;
and allow me to inform you that I have but to raise my hand and
voice&mdash;here in this street&mdash;and the
mob&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good God in heaven, Somerset,&rsquo; cried Zero,
turning deadly white and stopping in his walk, &lsquo;great God
in heaven, what words are these?&nbsp; Oh, not in jest, not even
in jest, should they be used!&nbsp; The brutal mob, the savage
passions . . . Somerset, for God&rsquo;s sake, a
public-house!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somerset considered him with freshly awakened curiosity.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This is very interesting,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
recoil from such a death?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who would not?&rsquo; asked the plotter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And to be blown up by dynamite,&rsquo; inquired the
young man, &lsquo;doubtless strikes you as a form of
euthanasia?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo; returned Zero: &lsquo;I own, and
since I have braved it daily in my professional career, I own it
even with pride: it is a death unusually distasteful to the mind
of man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One more question,&rsquo; said Somerset: &lsquo;you
object to Lynch Law? why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is assassination,&rsquo; said the plotter calmly,
but with eyebrows a little lifted, as in wonder at the
question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shake hands with me,&rsquo; cried Somerset.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thank God, I have now no ill-feeling left; and though you
cannot conceive how I burn to see you on the gallows, I can quite
contentedly assist at your departure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not very clearly take your meaning,&rsquo; said
Zero, &lsquo;but I am sure you mean kindly.&nbsp; As to my
departure, there is another point to be considered.&nbsp; I have
neglected to supply myself with funds; my little all has perished
in what history will love to relate under the name of the Golden
Square Atrocity; and without what is coarsely if vigorously
called stamps, you must be well aware it is impossible for me to
pass the ocean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For me,&rsquo; said Somerset, &lsquo;you have now
ceased to be a man.&nbsp; You have no more claim upon me than a
door scraper; but the touching confusion of your mind disarms me
from extremities.&nbsp; Until to-day, I always thought stupidity
was funny; I now know otherwise; and when I look upon your idiot
face, laughter rises within me like a deadly sickness, and the
tears spring up into my eyes as bitter as blood.&nbsp; What
should this portend?&nbsp; I begin to doubt; I am losing faith in
scepticism.&nbsp; Is it possible,&rsquo; he cried, in a kind of
horror of himself&mdash;&lsquo;is it conceivable that I believe
in right and wrong?&nbsp; Already I have found myself, with
incredulous surprise, to be the victim of a prejudice of personal
honour.&nbsp; And must this change proceed?&nbsp; Have you robbed
me of my youth?&nbsp; Must I fall, at my time of life, into the
Common Banker?&nbsp; But why should I address that head of
wood?&nbsp; Let this suffice.&nbsp; I dare not let you stay among
women and children; I lack the courage to denounce you, if by any
means I may avoid it; you have no money: well then, take mine,
and go; and if ever I behold your face after to-day, that day
will be your last.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Under the circumstances,&rsquo; replied Zero, &lsquo;I
scarce see my way to refuse your offer.&nbsp; Your expressions
may pain, they cannot surprise me; I am aware our point of view
requires a little training, a little moral hygiene, if I may so
express it; and one of the points that has always charmed me in
your character is this delightful frankness.&nbsp; As for the
small advance, it shall be remitted you from
Philadelphia.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It shall not,&rsquo; said Somerset.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear fellow, you do not understand,&rsquo; returned the
plotter.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall now be received with fresh
confidence by my superiors; and my experiments will be no longer
hampered by pitiful conditions of the purse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What I am now about, sir, is a crime,&rsquo; replied
Somerset; &lsquo;and were you to roll in wealth like Vanderbilt,
I should scorn to be reimbursed of money I had so scandalously
misapplied.&nbsp; Take it, and keep it.&nbsp; By George, sir,
three days of you have transformed me to an ancient
Roman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With these words, Somerset hailed a passing hansom; and the
pair were driven rapidly to the railway terminus.&nbsp; There, an
oath having been exacted, the money changed hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said Somerset, &lsquo;I have bought
back my honour with every penny I possess.&nbsp; And I thank God,
though there is nothing before me but starvation, I am free from
all entanglement with Mr. Zero Pumpernickel Jones.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To starve?&rsquo; cried Zero.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear fellow,
I cannot endure the thought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take your ticket!&rsquo; returned Somerset.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you display temper,&rsquo; said Zero.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take your ticket,&rsquo; reiterated the young man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the plotter, as he returned, ticket
in hand, &lsquo;your attitude is so strange and painful, that I
scarce know if I should ask you to shake hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As a man, no,&rsquo; replied Somerset; &lsquo;but I
have no objection to shake hands with you, as I might with a
pump-well that ran poison or bell-fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a very cold parting,&rsquo; sighed the
dynamiter; and still followed by Somerset, he began to descend
the platform.&nbsp; This was now bustling with passengers; the
train for Liverpool was just about to start, another had but
recently arrived; and the double tide made movement
difficult.&nbsp; As the pair reached the neighbourhood of the
bookstall, however, they came into an open space; and here the
attention of the plotter was attracted by a <i>Standard</i>
broadside bearing the words: &lsquo;Second Edition: Explosion in
Golden Square.&rsquo;&nbsp; His eye lighted; groping in his
pocket for the necessary coin, he sprang forward&mdash;his bag
knocked sharply on the corner of the stall&mdash;and instantly,
with a formidable report, the dynamite exploded.&nbsp; When the
smoke cleared away the stall was seen much shattered, and the
stall keeper running forth in terror from the ruins; but of the
Irish patriot or the Gladstone bag no adequate remains were to be
found.</p>
<p>In the first scramble of the alarm, Somerset made good his
escape, and came out upon the Euston Road, his head spinning, his
body sick with hunger, and his pockets destitute of coin.&nbsp;
Yet as he continued to walk the pavements, he wondered to find in
his heart a sort of peaceful exultation, a great content, a
sense, as it were, of divine presence and the kindliness of fate;
and he was able to tell himself that even if the worst befell, he
could now starve with a certain comfort since Zero was
expunged.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, he found himself at the door of Mr.
Godall&rsquo;s shop; and being quite unmanned by his long fast,
and scarce considering what he did, he opened the glass door and
entered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; said Mr. Godall, &lsquo;Mr. Somerset!&nbsp;
Well, have you met with an adventure?&nbsp; Have you the promised
story?&nbsp; Sit down, if you please; suffer me to choose you a
cigar of my own special brand; and reward me with a narrative in
your best style.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must not take a cigar,&rsquo; said Somerset.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said Mr. Godall.&nbsp; &lsquo;But now I
come to look at you more closely, I perceive that you are
changed.&nbsp; My poor boy, I hope there is nothing
wrong?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somerset burst into tears.</p>
<h2><!-- page 299--><a name="page299"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 299</span><i>EPILOGUE OF THE CIGAR
DIVAN</i></h2>
<p>On a certain day of lashing rain in the December of last year,
and between the hours of nine and ten in the morning, Mr. Edward
Challoner pioneered himself under an umbrella to the door of the
Cigar Divan in Rupert Street.&nbsp; It was a place he had visited
but once before: the memory of what had followed on that visit
and the fear of Somerset having prevented his return.&nbsp; Even
now, he looked in before he entered; but the shop was free of
customers.</p>
<p>The young man behind the counter was so intently writing in a
penny version-book, that he paid no heed to Challoner&rsquo;s
arrival.&nbsp; On a second glance, it seemed to the latter that
he recognised him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Jove,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;unquestionably
Somerset!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And though this was the very man he had been so sedulously
careful to avoid, his unexplained position at the receipt of
custom changed distaste to curiosity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Or opulent rotunda strike the sky,&rdquo;&rsquo;
said the shopman to himself, in the tone of one considering a
verse.&nbsp; &lsquo;I suppose it would be too much to say
&ldquo;orotunda,&rdquo; and yet how noble it were!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Or opulent orotunda strike the sky.&rdquo;&nbsp; But that
is the bitterness of arts; you see a good effect, and some
nonsense about sense continually intervenes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Somerset, my dear fellow,&rsquo; said Challoner,
&lsquo;is this a masquerade?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&nbsp; Challoner!&rsquo; cried the shopman.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am delighted to see you.&nbsp; One moment, till I finish
the octave of my sonnet: only the octave.&rsquo;&nbsp; And with a
friendly waggle of the hand, he once more buried himself in the
commerce of the Muses.&nbsp; &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; he said
presently, looking up, &lsquo;you seem in wonderful preservation:
how about the hundred pounds?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have made a small inheritance from a great aunt in
Wales,&rsquo; replied Challoner modestly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Somerset, &lsquo;I very much doubt the
legitimacy of inheritance.&nbsp; The State, in my view, should
collar it.&nbsp; I am now going through a stage of socialism and
poetry,&rsquo; he added apologetically, as one who spoke of a
course of medicinal waters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And are you really the person of
the&mdash;establishment?&rsquo; inquired Challoner, deftly
evading the word &lsquo;shop.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A vendor, sir, a vendor,&rsquo; returned the other,
pocketing his poesy.&nbsp; &lsquo;I help old Happy and
Glorious.&nbsp; Can I offer you a weed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I scarcely like . . . &rsquo; began
Challoner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, my dear fellow,&rsquo; cried the
shopman.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are very proud of the business; and the
old man, let me inform you, besides being the most egregious of
created beings from the point of view of ethics, is literally
sprung from the loins of kings.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>De Godall je suis
le fervent</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is only one Godall.&mdash;By
the way,&rsquo; he added, as Challoner lit his cigar, &lsquo;how
did you get on with the detective trade?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not try,&rsquo; said Challoner curtly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, well, I did,&rsquo; returned Somerset, &lsquo;and
made the most incomparable mess of it: lost all my money and
fairly covered myself with odium and ridicule.&nbsp; There is
more in that business, Challoner, than meets the eye; there is
more, in fact, in all businesses.&nbsp; You must believe in them,
or get up the belief that you believe.&nbsp; Hence,&rsquo; he
added, &lsquo;the recognised inferiority of the plumber, for no
one could believe in plumbing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>A propos</i>,&rsquo; asked Challoner, &lsquo;do you
still paint?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not now,&rsquo; replied Paul; &lsquo;but I think of
taking up the violin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Challoner&rsquo;s eye, which had been somewhat restless since
the trade of the detective had been named, now rested for a
moment on the columns of the morning paper, where it lay spread
upon the counter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Jove,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s
odd!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is odd?&rsquo; asked Paul.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, nothing,&rsquo; returned the other: &lsquo;only I
once met a person called M&rsquo;Guire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So did I!&rsquo; cried Somerset.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is there
anything about him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Challoner read as follows: &lsquo;<i>Mysterious death in
Stepney</i>.&nbsp; An inquest was held yesterday on the body of
Patrick M&rsquo;Guire, described as a carpenter.&nbsp; Doctor
Dovering stated that he had for some time treated the deceased as
a dispensary patient, for sleeplessness, loss of appetite, and
nervous depression.&nbsp; There was no cause of death to be
found.&nbsp; He would say the deceased had sunk.&nbsp; Deceased
was not a temperate man, which doubtless accelerated death.&nbsp;
Deceased complained of dumb ague, but witness had never been able
to detect any positive disease.&nbsp; He did not know that he had
any family.&nbsp; He regarded him as a person of unsound
intellect, who believed himself a member and the victim of some
secret society.&nbsp; If he were to hazard an opinion, he would
say deceased had died of fear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the doctor would be right,&rsquo; cried Somerset;
&lsquo;and my dear Challoner, I am so relieved to hear of his
demise, that I will&mdash;Well, after all,&rsquo; he added,
&lsquo;poor devil, he was well served.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The door at this moment opened, and Desborough appeared upon
the threshold.&nbsp; He was wrapped in a long waterproof,
imperfectly supplied with buttons; his boots were full of water,
his hat greasy with service; and yet he wore the air of one
exceeding well content with life.&nbsp; He was hailed by the two
others with exclamations of surprise and welcome.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And did you try the detective business?&rsquo; inquired
Paul.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; returned Harry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh yes, by the
way, I did though: twice, and got caught out both times.&nbsp;
But I thought I should find my&mdash;my wife here?&rsquo; he
added, with a kind of proud confusion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What? are you married?&rsquo; cried Somerset.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; said Harry, &lsquo;quite a long time: a
month at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Money?&rsquo; asked Challoner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of it,&rsquo; Desborough
admitted.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are deadly hard up.&nbsp; But the
Pri--- Mr. Godall is going to do something for us.&nbsp; That is
what brings us here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who was Mrs. Desborough?&rsquo; said Challoner, in the
tone of a man of society.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was a Miss Luxmore,&rsquo; returned Harry.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You fellows will be sure to like her, for she is much
cleverer than I.&nbsp; She tells wonderful stories, too; better
than a book.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And just then the door opened, and Mrs. Desborough
entered.&nbsp; Somerset cried out aloud to recognise the young
lady of the Superfluous Mansion, and Challoner fell back a step
and dropped his cigar as he beheld the sorceress of Chelsea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; cried Harry, &lsquo;do you both know my
wife?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe I have seen her,&rsquo; said Somerset, a
little wildly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I have met the gentleman,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Desborough sweetly; &lsquo;but I cannot imagine where it
was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no,&rsquo; cried Somerset fervently: &lsquo;I have
no notion&mdash;I cannot conceive&mdash;where it could have
been.&nbsp; Indeed,&rsquo; he continued, growing in emphasis,
&lsquo;I think it highly probable that it&rsquo;s a
mistake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you, Challoner?&rsquo; asked Harry, &lsquo;you
seemed to recognise her too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;These are both friends of yours, Harry?&rsquo; said the
lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;Delighted, I am sure.&nbsp; I do not remember
to have met Mr. Challoner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Challoner was very red in the face, perhaps from having groped
after his cigar.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not remember to have had the
pleasure,&rsquo; he responded huskily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, and Mr. Godall?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Desborough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you the lady that has an appointment with
old&mdash;&rsquo; began Somerset, and paused blushing.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Because if so,&rsquo; he resumed, &lsquo;I was to announce
you at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the shopman raised a curtain, opened a door, and passed
into a small pavilion which had been added to the back of the
house.&nbsp; On the roof, the rain resounded musically.&nbsp; The
walls were lined with maps and prints and a few works of
reference.&nbsp; Upon a table was a large-scale map of Egypt and
the Soudan, and another of Tonkin, on which, by the aid of
coloured pins, the progress of the different wars was being
followed day by day.&nbsp; A light, refreshing odour of the most
delicate tobacco hung upon the air; and a fire, not of foul coal,
but of clear-flaming resinous billets, chattered upon silver
dogs.&nbsp; In this elegant and plain apartment, Mr. Godall sat
in a morning muse, placidly gazing at the fire and hearkening to
the rain upon the roof.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha, my dear Mr. Somerset,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and
have you since last night adopted any fresh political
principle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The lady, sir,&rsquo; said Somerset, with another
blush.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have seen her, I believe?&rsquo; returned Mr.
Godall; and on Somerset&rsquo;s replying in the affirmative,
&lsquo;You will excuse me, my dear sir,&rsquo; he resumed,
&lsquo;if I offer you a hint.&nbsp; I think it not improbable
this lady may desire entirely to forget the past.&nbsp; From one
gentleman to another, no more words are necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A moment after, he had received Mrs. Desborough with that
grave and touching urbanity that so well became him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am pleased, madam, to welcome you to my poor
house,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and shall be still more so, if what
were else a barren courtesy and a pleasure personal to myself,
shall prove to be of serious benefit to you and Mr.
Desborough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your Highness,&rsquo; replied Clara, &lsquo;I must
begin with thanks; it is like what I have heard of you, that you
should thus take up the case of the unfortunate; and as for my
Harry, he is worthy of all that you can do.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
paused.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But for yourself?&rsquo; suggested Mr.
Godall&mdash;&lsquo;it was thus you were about to continue, I
believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You take the words out of my mouth,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;For myself, it is different.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not here to be a judge of men,&rsquo; replied the
Prince; &lsquo;still less of women.&nbsp; I am now a private
person like yourself and many million others; but I am one who
still fights upon the side of quiet.&nbsp; Now, madam, you know
better than I, and God better than you, what you have done to
mankind in the past; I pause not to inquire; it is with the
future I concern myself, it is for the future I demand
security.&nbsp; I would not willingly put arms into the hands of
a disloyal combatant; and I dare not restore to wealth one of the
levyers of a private and a barbarous war.&nbsp; I speak with some
severity, and yet I pick my terms.&nbsp; I tell myself
continually that you are a woman; and a voice continually reminds
me of the children whose lives and limbs you have
endangered.&nbsp; A woman,&rsquo; he repeated
solemnly&mdash;&lsquo;and children.&nbsp; Possibly, madam, when
you are yourself a mother, you will feel the bite of that
antithesis: possibly when you kneel at night beside a cradle, a
fear will fall upon you, heavier than any shame; and when your
child lies in the pain and danger of disease, you shall hesitate
to kneel before your Maker.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You look at the fault,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and not
at the excuse.&nbsp; Has your own heart never leaped within you
at some story of oppression?&nbsp; But, alas, no! for you were
born upon a throne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was born of woman,&rsquo; said the Prince; &lsquo;I
came forth from my mother&rsquo;s agony, helpless as a wren, like
other nurselings.&nbsp; This, which you forgot, I have still
faithfully remembered.&nbsp; Is it not one of your English poets,
that looked abroad upon the earth and saw vast circumvallations,
innumerable troops manoeuvring, warships at sea and a great dust
of battles on shore; and casting anxiously about for what should
be the cause of so many and painful preparations, spied at last,
in the centre of all, a mother and her babe?&nbsp; These, madam,
are my politics; and the verses, which are by Mr. Coventry
Patmore, I have caused to be translated into the Bohemian
tongue.&nbsp; Yes, these are my politics: to change what we can,
to better what we can; but still to bear in mind that man is but
a devil weakly fettered by some generous beliefs and impositions,
and for no word however nobly sounding, and no cause however just
and pious, to relax the stricture of these bonds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a silence of a moment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear, madam,&rsquo; resumed the Prince, &lsquo;that I
but weary you.&nbsp; My views are formal like myself; and like
myself, they also begin to grow old.&nbsp; But I must still
trouble you for some reply.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can say but one thing,&rsquo; said Mrs. Desborough:
&lsquo;I love my husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a good answer,&rsquo; returned the Prince;
&lsquo;and you name a good influence, but one that need not be
conterminous with life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not play at pride with such a man as you,&rsquo;
she answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you ask of me? not
protestations, I am sure.&nbsp; What shall I say?&nbsp; I have
done much that I cannot defend and that I would not do
again.&nbsp; Can I say more?&nbsp; Yes: I can say this: I never
abused myself with the muddle-headed fairy tales of
politics.&nbsp; I was at least prepared to meet reprisals.&nbsp;
While I was levying war myself&mdash;or levying murder, if you
choose the plainer term&mdash;I never accused my adversaries of
assassination.&nbsp; I never felt or feigned a righteous horror,
when a price was put upon my life by those whom I attacked.&nbsp;
I never called the policeman a hireling.&nbsp; I may have been a
criminal, in short; but I never was a fool.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Enough, madam,&rsquo; returned the Prince: &lsquo;more
than enough!&nbsp; Your words are most reviving to my spirits;
for in this age, when even the assassin is a sentimentalist,
there is no virtue greater in my eyes than intellectual
clarity.&nbsp; Suffer me, then, to ask you to retire; for by the
signal of that bell, I perceive my old friend, your mother, to be
close at hand.&nbsp; With her I promise you to do my
utmost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And as Mrs. Desborough returned to the Divan, the Prince,
opening a door upon the other side, admitted Mrs. Luxmore.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam and my very good friend,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;is my face so much changed that you no longer recognise
Prince Florizel in Mr. Godall?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure!&rsquo; she cried, looking at him through
her glasses.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have always regarded your Highness as
a perfect man; and in your altered circumstances, of which I have
already heard with deep regret, I will beg you to consider my
respect increased instead of lessened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have found it so,&rsquo; returned the Prince,
&lsquo;with every class of my acquaintance.&nbsp; But, madam, I
pray you to be seated.&nbsp; My business is of a delicate order,
and regards your daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In that case,&rsquo; said Mrs. Luxmore, &lsquo;you may
save yourself the trouble of speaking, for I have fully made up
my mind to have nothing to do with her.&nbsp; I will not hear one
word in her defence; but as I value nothing so particularly as
the virtue of justice, I think it my duty to explain to you the
grounds of my complaint.&nbsp; She deserted me, her natural
protector; for years, she has consorted with the most
disreputable persons; and to fill the cup of her offence, she has
recently married.&nbsp; I refuse to see her, or the being to whom
she has linked herself.&nbsp; One hundred and twenty pounds a
year, I have always offered her: I offer it again.&nbsp; It is
what I had myself when I was her age.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, madam,&rsquo; said the Prince; &lsquo;and be
that so!&nbsp; But to touch upon another matter: what was the
income of the Reverend Bernard Fanshawe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father?&rsquo; asked the spirited old lady.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I believe he had seven hundred pounds in the
year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were one, I think, of several?&rsquo; pursued the
Prince.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of four,&rsquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;We were
four daughters; and painful as the admission is to make, a more
detestable family could scarce be found in England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; said the Prince.&nbsp; &lsquo;And you,
madam, have an income of eight thousand?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not more than five,&rsquo; returned the old lady;
&lsquo;but where on earth are you conducting me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To an allowance of one thousand pounds a year,&rsquo;
replied Florizel, smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;For I must not suffer you
to take your father for a rule.&nbsp; He was poor, you are
rich.&nbsp; He had many calls upon his poverty: there are none
upon your wealth.&nbsp; And indeed, madam, if you will let me
touch this matter with a needle, there is but one point in common
to your two positions: that each had a daughter more remarkable
for liveliness than duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been entrapped into this house,&rsquo; said the
old lady, getting to her feet.&nbsp; &lsquo;But it shall not
avail.&nbsp; Not all the tobacconists in Europe . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, madam,&rsquo; interrupted Florizel, &lsquo;before
what is referred to as my fall, you had not used such
language!&nbsp; And since you so much object to the simple
industry by which I live, let me give you a friendly hint.&nbsp;
If you will not consent to support your daughter, I shall be
constrained to place that lady behind my counter, where I doubt
not she would prove a great attraction; and your son-in-law shall
have a livery and run the errands.&nbsp; With such young blood my
business might be doubled, and I might be bound in common
gratitude to place the name of Luxmore beside that of
Godall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your Highness,&rsquo; said the old lady, &lsquo;I have
been very rude, and you are very cunning.&nbsp; I suppose the
minx is on the premises.&nbsp; Produce her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us rather observe them unperceived,&rsquo; said the
Prince; and so saying he rose and quietly drew back the
curtain.</p>
<p>Mrs. Desborough sat with her back to them on a chair; Somerset
and Harry were hanging on her words with extraordinary interest;
Challoner, alleging some affair, had long ago withdrawn from the
detested neighbourhood of the enchantress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At that moment,&rsquo; Mrs. Desborough was saying,
&lsquo;Mr Gladstone detected the features of his cowardly
assailant.&nbsp; A cry rose to his lips: a cry of mingled triumph
. . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is Mr. Somerset!&rsquo; interrupted the spirited
old lady, in the highest note of her register.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr.
Somerset, what have you done with my house-property?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; said the Prince, &lsquo;let it be mine to
give the explanation; and in the meanwhile, welcome your
daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Clara, how do you do?&rsquo; said Mrs.
Luxmore.&nbsp; &lsquo;It appears I am to give you an
allowance.&nbsp; So much the better for you.&nbsp; As for Mr.
Somerset, I am very ready to have an explanation; for the whole
affair, though costly, was eminently humorous.&nbsp; And at any
rate,&rsquo; she added, nodding to Paul, &lsquo;he is a young
gentleman for whom I have a great affection, and his pictures
were the funniest I ever saw.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have ordered a collation,&rsquo; said the
Prince.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Somerset, as these are all your friends,
I propose, if you please, that you should join them at
table.&nbsp; I will take the shop.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p><a name="footnote9"></a><a href="#citation9"
class="footnote">[9]</a>&nbsp; Hereupon the Arabian author enters
on one of his digressions.&nbsp; Fearing, apparently, that the
somewhat eccentric views of Mr. Somerset should throw discredit
on a part of truth, he calls upon the English people to remember
with more gratitude the services of the police; to what
unobserved and solitary acts of heroism they are called; against
what odds of numbers and of arms, and for how small a reward,
either in fame or money: matter, it has appeared to the
translators, too serious for this place.</p>
<p><a name="footnote43"></a><a href="#citation43"
class="footnote">[43]</a>&nbsp; In this name the accent falls
upon the <i>e</i>; the <i>s</i> is sibilant.</p>
<p><a name="footnote176"></a><a href="#citation176"
class="footnote">[176]</a>&nbsp; The Arabian author of the
original has here a long passage conceived in a style too
oriental for the English reader.&nbsp; We subjoin a specimen, and
it seems doubtful whether it should be printed as prose or verse:
&lsquo;Any writard who writes dynamitard shall find in me a
never-resting fightard;&rsquo; and he goes on (if we correctly
gather his meaning) to object to such elegant and obviously
correct spellings as lamp-lightard, corn-dealard, apple-filchard
(clearly justified by the parallel&mdash;pilchard) and opera
dancard.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dynamitist,&rsquo; he adds, &lsquo;I could
understand.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote182"></a><a href="#citation182"
class="footnote">[182]</a>&nbsp; The Arabian author, with that
quaint particularity of touch which our translation usually
pr&aelig;termits, here registers a somewhat interesting
detail.&nbsp; Zero pronounced the word &lsquo;boom;&rsquo; and
the reader, if but for the nonce, will possibly consent to follow
him.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
